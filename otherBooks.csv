id,"Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.",RLS
ID,"At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life.",RLS
ID,"He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years.",RLS
ID,"But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I incline to CainŠ—Ès heresy,Š—  he used to say quaintly: Š—“I let my brother go to the devil in his own wayŠ—.",RLS
ID,"In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men.",RLS
ID,"And to such as these, so long as they came about his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.",RLS
ID,"No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature.",RLS
ID,It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyerŠ—Ès way.,RLS
ID,"His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object.",RLS
ID,"Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town.",RLS
ID,"It was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.",RLS
ID,"It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend.",RLS
ID,"For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.",RLS
ID,It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London.,RLS
ID,"The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays.",RLS
ID,"The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen.",RLS
ID,"Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.",RLS
ID,"Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street.",RLS
ID,"It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence.",RLS
ID,"The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained.",RLS
ID,"Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.",RLS
ID,"Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed.",RLS
ID,Š—“Did you ever remark that door?,RLS
ID,Š— he asked; and when his companion had replied in the affirmative.,RLS
ID,"Š—“It is connected in my mind,Š— added he, Š—“with a very odd storyŠ—.",RLS
ID,Š—“Indeed?,RLS
ID,"Š— said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, Š—“and what was that?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Well, it was this way,Š— returned Mr. Enfield: Š—“I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three oŠ—Èclock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps.",RLS
ID,"Street after street and all the folks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman.",RLS
ID,"All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street.",RLS
ID,"Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the childŠ—Ès body and left her screaming on the ground.",RLS
ID,"It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see.",RLS
ID,It wasnŠ—Èt like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut.,RLS
ID,"I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child.",RLS
ID,"He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running.",RLS
ID,"The people who had turned out were the girlŠ—Ès own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent put in his appearance.",RLS
ID,"Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it.",RLS
ID,But there was one curious circumstance.,RLS
ID,I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight.,RLS
ID,"So had the childŠ—Ès family, which was only natural.",RLS
ID,But the doctorŠ—Ès case was what struck me.,RLS
ID,"He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe.",RLS
ID,"Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him.",RLS
ID,"I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best.",RLS
ID,We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other.,RLS
ID,"If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them.",RLS
ID,"And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies.",RLS
ID,"I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see that--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan.",RLS
ID,"`If you choose to make capital out of this accident,Š—È said he, `I am naturally helpless.",RLS
ID,"No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,Š—È says he.",RLS
ID,`Name your figure.,RLS
ID,"Š—È Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the childŠ—Ès family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck.",RLS
ID,The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?,RLS
ID,#NAME?,RLS
ID,The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine.,RLS
ID,"I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another manŠ—Ès cheque for close upon a hundred pounds.",RLS
ID,But he was quite easy and sneering.,RLS
ID,"`Set your mind at rest,Š—È says he, `I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.",RLS
ID,"Š—È So we all set off, the doctor, and the childŠ—Ès father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank.",RLS
ID,"I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery.",RLS
ID,Not a bit of it.,RLS
ID,The cheque was genuineŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Tut-tut,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I see you feel as I do,Š— said Mr. Enfield.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes, itŠ—Ès a bad story.",RLS
ID,"For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good.",RLS
ID,Black mail I suppose; an honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth.,RLS
ID,"Black Mail House is what I call the place with the door, in consequence.",RLS
ID,"Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all,Š— he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing.",RLS
ID,From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: Š—“And you donŠ—Èt know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“A likely place, isnŠ—Èt it?",RLS
ID,Š— returned Mr. Enfield.,RLS
ID,Š—“But I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or otherŠ—.,RLS
ID,Š—“And you never asked about the--place with the door?,RLS
ID,Š— said Mr. Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Š—“No, sir: I had a delicacy,Š— was the reply.",RLS
ID,Š—“I feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment.,RLS
ID,"You start a question, and itŠ—Ès like starting a stone.",RLS
ID,"You sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name.",RLS
ID,"No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I askŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“A very good rule, too,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“But I have studied the place for myself,Š— continued Mr. Enfield.",RLS
ID,Š—“It seems scarcely a house.,RLS
ID,"There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure.",RLS
ID,There are three windows looking on the court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but theyŠ—Ère clean.,RLS
ID,And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there.,RLS
ID,"And yet itŠ—Ès not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that itŠ—Ès hard to say where one ends and another beginsŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then Š—“Enfield,Š—  said Mr. Utterson, Š—“thatŠ—Ès a good rule of yoursŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes, I think it is,Š— returned Enfield.",RLS
ID,"Š—“But for all that,Š— continued the lawyer, Š—“thereŠ—Ès one point I want to ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the childŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well,Š— said Mr. Enfield, Š—“I canŠ—Èt see what harm it would do.",RLS
ID,It was a man of the name of HydeŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Hm,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,Š—“What sort of a man is he to see?,RLS
ID,Š—  Š—“He is not easy to describe.,RLS
ID,"There is something wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable.",RLS
ID,"I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why.",RLS
ID,"He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I couldnŠ—Èt specify the point.",RLS
ID,"HeŠ—Ès an extraordinary looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of the way.",RLS
ID,"No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I canŠ—Èt describe him.",RLS
ID,And itŠ—Ès not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this momentŠ—.,RLS
ID,Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration.,RLS
ID,Š—“You are sure he used a key?,RLS
ID,Š— he inquired at last.,RLS
ID,Š—“My dear sir.,RLS
ID,.,RLS
ID,Š—.,RLS
ID,"began Enfield, surprised out of himself.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes, I know,Š— said Utterson; Š—“I know it must seem strange.",RLS
ID,"The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already.",RLS
ID,"You see, Richard, your tale has gone home.",RLS
ID,If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct itŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I think you might have warned me,Š— returned the other with a touch of sullenness.",RLS
ID,"Š—“But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it.",RLS
ID,"The fellow had a key; and whatŠ—Ès more, he has it still.",RLS
ID,I saw him use it not a week agoŠ—.,RLS
ID,Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man presently resumed.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Here is another lesson to say nothing,Š— said he.",RLS
ID,Š—“I am ashamed of my long tongue.,RLS
ID,Let us make a bargain never to refer to this againŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“With all my heart,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I shake hands on that, RichardŠ—.",RLS
ID,SEARCH FOR MR.,RLS
ID,HYDE   That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish.,RLS
ID,"It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed.",RLS
ID,"On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room.",RLS
ID,"There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. JekyllŠ—Ès Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents.",RLS
ID,"The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc.",RLS
ID,", all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his Š—“friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,Š— but that in case of Dr. JekyllŠ—Ès Š—“disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,Š— the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry JekyllŠ—Ès shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctorŠ—Ès household.",RLS
ID,This document had long been the lawyerŠ—Ès eyesore.,RLS
ID,"It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest.",RLS
ID,"And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge.",RLS
ID,It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more.,RLS
ID,"It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I thought it was madness,Š— he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, Š—“and now I begin to fear it is disgraceŠ—.",RLS
ID,"With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients.",RLS
ID,"Š—“If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,Š— he had thought.",RLS
ID,"The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine.",RLS
ID,"This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner.",RLS
ID,"At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands.",RLS
ID,"The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling.",RLS
ID,"For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each other, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each otherŠ—Ès company.",RLS
ID,"After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I suppose, Lanyon,Š— said he, Š—“you and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“I wish the friends were younger,Š— chuckled Dr. Lanyon.",RLS
ID,Š—“But I suppose we are.,RLS
ID,And what of that?,RLS
ID,I see little of him nowŠ—.,RLS
ID,Š—“Indeed?,RLS
ID,Š— said Utterson.,RLS
ID,Š—“I thought you had a bond of common interestŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“We had,Š— was the reply.",RLS
ID,Š—“But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me.,RLS
ID,"He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sakeŠ—Ès sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the man.",RLS
ID,"Such unscientific balderdash,Š— added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, Š—“would have estranged Damon and PythiasŠ—.",RLS
ID,This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Š—“They have only differed on some point of science,Š— he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: Š—“It is nothing worse than that!",RLS
ID,"Š— He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put.",RLS
ID,Š—“Did you ever come across a protege of his--one Hyde?,RLS
ID,Š— he asked.,RLS
ID,Š—“Hyde?,RLS
ID,Š— repeated Lanyon.,RLS
ID,Š—“No.,RLS
ID,Never heard of him.,RLS
ID,Since my timeŠ—.,RLS
ID,"That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large.",RLS
ID,"It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by questions.",RLS
ID,"Six oŠ—Èclock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. UttersonŠ—Ès dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem.",RLS
ID,"Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. EnfieldŠ—Ès tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures.",RLS
ID,"He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctorŠ—Ès; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.",RLS
ID,"Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo!",RLS
ID,"there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding.",RLS
ID,"The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming.",RLS
ID,"And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyerŠ—Ès mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde.",RLS
ID,"If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined.",RLS
ID,He might see a reason for his friendŠ—Ès strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will.,RLS
ID,"At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.",RLS
ID,"From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the by-street of shops.",RLS
ID,"In the morning before office hours, at noon when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.",RLS
ID,"Š—“If he be Mr. Hyde,Š— he had thought, Š—“I shall be Mr. SeekŠ—.",RLS
ID,And at last his patience was rewarded.,RLS
ID,"It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow.",RLS
ID,"By ten oŠ—Èclock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent.",RLS
ID,Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time.,RLS
ID,"Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near.",RLS
ID,"In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city.",RLS
ID,"Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.",RLS
ID,"The steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street.",RLS
ID,"The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with.",RLS
ID,"He was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against the watcherŠ—Ès inclination.",RLS
ID,"But he made straight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.",RLS
ID,Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Mr. Hyde, I think?",RLS
ID,Š—  Mr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath.,RLS
ID,"But his fear was only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he answered coolly enough: Š—“That is my name.",RLS
ID,What do you want?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“I see you are going in,Š— returned the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I am an old friend of Dr. JekyllŠ—Ès--Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street--you must have heard of my name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit meŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,Š— replied Mr. Hyde, blowing in the key.",RLS
ID,"And then suddenly, but still without looking up, Š—“How did you know me?",RLS
ID,Š— he asked.,RLS
ID,"Š—“On your side,Š— said Mr. Utterson Š—“will you do me a favour?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“With pleasure,Š— replied the other.",RLS
ID,Š—“What shall it be?,RLS
ID,Š—  Š—“Will you let me see your face?,RLS
ID,Š— asked the lawyer.,RLS
ID,"Mr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Now I shall know you again,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,Š—“It may be usefulŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes,Š— returned Mr. Hyde, Š—“It is as well we have met; and apropos, you should have my addressŠ—.",RLS
ID,And he gave a number of a street in Soho.,RLS
ID,Š—“Good God!,RLS
ID,"Š— thought Mr. Utterson, Š—“can he, too, have been thinking of the will?",RLS
ID,Š— But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address.,RLS
ID,"Š—“And now,Š— said the other, Š—“how did you know me?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“By description,Š— was the reply.",RLS
ID,Š—“Whose description?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“We have common friends,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Common friends,Š— echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely.",RLS
ID,Š—“Who are they?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Jekyll, for instance,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“He never told you,Š— cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger.",RLS
ID,Š—“I did not think you would have liedŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Come,Š— said Mr. Utterson, Š—“that is not fitting languageŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house.",RLS
ID,"The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude.",RLS
ID,"Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity.",RLS
ID,"The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved.",RLS
ID,"Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.",RLS
ID,"Š—“There must be something else,Š— said the perplexed gentleman.",RLS
ID,"Š—“There is something more, if I could find a name for it.",RLS
ID,"God bless me, the man seems hardly human!",RLS
ID,"Something troglodytic, shall we say?",RLS
ID,or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell?,RLS
ID,"or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent?",RLS
ID,"The last, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read SatanŠ—Ès signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friendŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Round the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises.",RLS
ID,"One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked.",RLS
ID,"A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?",RLS
ID,Š— asked the lawyer.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I will see, Mr. Utterson,Š— said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Will you wait here by the fire, sir?",RLS
ID,or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Here, thank you,Š— said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender.",RLS
ID,"This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctorŠ—Ès; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London.",RLS
ID,"But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof.",RLS
ID,"He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,Š— he said.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?",RLS

ID,"Š—“Good-night, Mr. UttersonŠ—.",RLS
ID,And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Poor Harry Jekyll,Š— he thought, Š—“my mind misgives me he is in deep waters!",RLS
ID,"He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations.",RLS
ID,"Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, PEDE CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the faultŠ—.",RLS
ID,"And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there.",RLS
ID,"His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.",RLS
ID,"And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This Master Hyde, if he were studied,Š— thought he, Š—“must have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared to which poor JekyllŠ—Ès worst would be like sunshine.",RLS
ID,Things cannot continue as they are.,RLS
ID,"It turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to HarryŠ—Ès bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!",RLS
ID,"And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit.",RLS
ID,"Ay, I must put my shoulders to the wheel--if Jekyll will but let me,Š— he added, Š—“if Jekyll will only let meŠ—.",RLS
ID,"For once more he saw before his mindŠ—Ès eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will.",RLS
ID,DR.,RLS
ID,"JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE   A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others had departed.",RLS
ID,"This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times.",RLS
ID,"Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well.",RLS
ID,"Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the manŠ—Ès rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety.",RLS
ID,"To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire--a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness--you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,Š— began the latter.",RLS
ID,Š—“You know that will of yours?,RLS
ID,Š—  A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor carried it off gaily.,RLS
ID,"Š—“My poor Utterson,Š— said he, Š—“you are unfortunate in such a client.",RLS
ID,"I never saw a man so distressed as you were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what he called my scientific heresies.",RLS
ID,"O, I know heŠ—Ès a good fellow--you neednŠ—Èt frown--an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.",RLS
ID,I was never more disappointed in any man than LanyonŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“You know I never approved of it,Š— pursued Utterson, ruthlessly disregarding the fresh topic.",RLS
ID,Š—“My will?,RLS
ID,"Yes, certainly, I know that,Š— said the doctor, a trifle sharply.",RLS
ID,Š—“You have told me soŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Well, I tell you so again,Š— continued the lawyer.",RLS
ID,Š—“I have been learning something of young HydeŠ—.,RLS
ID,"The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I do not care to hear more,Š—  said he.",RLS
ID,Š—“This is a matter I thought we had agreed to dropŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“What I heard was abominable,Š— said Utterson.",RLS
ID,Š—“It can make no change.,RLS
ID,"You do not understand my position,Š— returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one.",RLS
ID,It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talkingŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Jekyll,Š— said Utterson, Š—“you know me: I am a man to be trusted.",RLS
ID,Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of itŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“My good Utterson,Š— said the doctor, Š—“this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in.",RLS
ID,"I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isnŠ—Èt what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.",RLS
ID,"I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that IŠ—Èm sure youŠ—Èll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleepŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I have no doubt you are perfectly right,Š— he said at last, getting to his feet.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope,Š— continued the doctor, Š—“there is one point I should like you to understand.",RLS
ID,I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde.,RLS
ID,I know you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude.,RLS
ID,"But I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him.",RLS
ID,"I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promiseŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I canŠ—Èt pretend that I shall ever like him,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I donŠ—Èt ask that,Š— pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the otherŠ—Ès arm; Š—“I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer hereŠ—.",RLS
ID,Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Well,Š— said he, Š—“I promiseŠ—.",RLS
ID,"THE CAREW MURDER CASE   Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18--, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim.",RLS
ID,The details were few and startling.,RLS
ID,"A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven.",RLS
ID,"Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maidŠ—Ès window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon.",RLS
ID,"It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing.",RLS
ID,"Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of the world.",RLS
ID,"And as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention.",RLS
ID,When they had come within speech (which was just under the maidŠ—Ès eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.,RLS
ID,"It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it some times appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content.",RLS
ID,"Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a dislike.",RLS
ID,"He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience.",RLS
ID,"And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman.",RLS
ID,"The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth.",RLS
ID,"And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway.",RLS
ID,"At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.",RLS
ID,It was two oŠ—Èclock when she came to herself and called for the police.,RLS
ID,"The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled.",RLS
ID,"The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter--the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer.",RLS
ID,"A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I shall say nothing till I have seen the body,Š— said he; Š—“this may be very serious.",RLS
ID,Have the kindness to wait while I dressŠ—.,RLS
ID,"And with the same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been carried.",RLS
ID,"As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes,Š— said he, Š—“I recognise him.",RLS
ID,I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers CarewŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Good God, sir,Š— exclaimed the officer, Š—“is it possible?",RLS
ID,Š— And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition.,RLS
ID,"Š—“This will make a deal of noise,Š— he said.",RLS
ID,Š—“And perhaps you can help us to the manŠ—.,RLS
ID,"And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick.",RLS
ID,"Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it was, he recognized it for one that he had himself presented many years before to Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,Š—“Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?,RLS
ID,Š— he inquired.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him,Š— said the officer.",RLS
ID,"Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, Š—“If you will come with me in my cab,Š— he said, Š—“I think I can take you to his houseŠ—.",RLS
ID,"It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the season.",RLS
ID,"A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a marvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.",RLS
ID,"The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyerŠ—Ès eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare.",RLS
ID,"The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the lawŠ—Ès officers, which may at times assail the most honest.",RLS
ID,"As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.",RLS
ID,This was the home of Henry JekyllŠ—Ès favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.,RLS
ID,An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door.,RLS
ID,"She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent.",RLS
ID,"Yes, she said, this was Mr. HydeŠ—Ès, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,Š— said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, Š—“I had better tell you who this person is,Š— he added.",RLS
ID,Š—“This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland YardŠ—.,RLS
ID,A flash of odious joy appeared upon the womanŠ—Ès face.,RLS
ID,Š—“Ah!,RLS
ID,"Š— said she, Š—“he is in trouble!",RLS
ID,What has he done?,RLS
ID,Š—  Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances.,RLS
ID,"Š—“He donŠ—Èt seem a very popular character,Š— observed the latter.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about usŠ—.",RLS
ID,"In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste.",RLS
ID,"A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour.",RLS
ID,"At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned.",RLS
ID,"From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted.",RLS
ID,"A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murdererŠ—Ès credit, completed his gratification.",RLS
ID,"Š—“You may depend upon it, sir,Š— he told Mr. Utterson: Š—“I have him in my hand.",RLS
ID,"He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the cheque book.",RLS
ID,"Why, moneyŠ—Ès life to the man.",RLS
ID,"We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbillsŠ—.",RLS
ID,"This last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered few familiars--even the master of the servant maid had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as common observers will.",RLS
ID,Only on one point were they agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.,RLS
ID,"INCIDENT OF THE LETTER   It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. JekyllŠ—Ès door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms.",RLS
ID,"The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden.",RLS
ID,"It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friendŠ—Ès quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola.",RLS
ID,"At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctorŠ—Ès cabinet.",RLS
ID,"It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron.",RLS
ID,"The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick.",RLS
ID,"He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And now,Š— said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, Š—“you have heard the news?",RLS
ID,Š—  The doctor shuddered.,RLS
ID,"Š—“They were crying it in the square,Š— he said.",RLS
ID,Š—“I heard them in my dining-roomŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“One word,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Carew was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am doing.",RLS
ID,You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Utterson, I swear to God,Š— cried the doctor, Š—“I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again.",RLS
ID,I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this world.,RLS

ID,"And indeed he does not want my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard ofŠ—.",RLS

ID,I have--I have received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police.,RLS

ID,"Š—“You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?",RLS
ID,Š— asked the lawyer.,RLS
ID,"Š—“No,Š— said the other.",RLS

ID,"I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposedŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friendŠ—Ès selfishness, and yet relieved by it.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well,Š— said he, at last, Š—“let me see the letterŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed Š—“Edward HydeŠ—: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writerŠ—Ès benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence.",RLS
ID,The lawyer liked this letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.,RLS
ID,Š—“Have you the envelope?,RLS
ID,Š— he asked.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I burned it,Š— replied Jekyll, Š—“before I thought what I was about.",RLS

ID,Š—“He meant to murder you.,RLS

ID,"On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“By the bye,Š— said he, Š—“there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?",RLS
ID,"Š— But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; Š—“and only circulars by that,Š— he added.",RLS
ID,This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed.,RLS
ID,"Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution.",RLS
ID,"The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: Š—“Special edition.",RLS
ID,Shocking murder of an M.P.Š— That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal.,RLS
ID,"It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice.",RLS
ID,"It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.",RLS
ID,"Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house.",RLS
ID,"The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, the procession of the townŠ—Ès life was still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind.",RLS
ID,But the room was gay with firelight.,RLS

ID,There was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant.,RLS
ID,"Guest had often been on business to the doctorŠ—Ès; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. HydeŠ—Ès familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to right?",RLS
ID,"and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging?",RLS
ID,"The clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson might shape his future course.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,Š— he said.",RLS

ID,"On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“The doctor was confined to the house,Š— Poole said, Š—“and saw no oneŠ—.",RLS
ID,"On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits.",RLS
ID,The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. LanyonŠ—Ès.,RLS
ID,"There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctorŠ—Ès appearance.",RLS
ID,He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face.,RLS
ID,"The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyerŠ—Ès notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind.",RLS
ID,It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Yes,Š— he thought; Š—“he is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bearŠ—.",RLS
ID,"And yet when Utterson remarked on his ill-looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I have had a shock,Š— he said, Š—“and I shall never recover.",RLS
ID,It is a question of weeks.,RLS
ID,"Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it.",RLS
ID,"I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get awayŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Jekyll is ill, too,Š— observed Utterson.",RLS
ID,Š—“Have you seen him?,RLS
ID,"Š—  But LanyonŠ—Ès face changed, and he held up a trembling hand.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,Š— he said in a loud, unsteady voice.",RLS
ID,Š—“I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as deadŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Tut-tut,Š— said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, Š—“CanŠ—Èt I do anything?",RLS
ID,Š— he inquired.,RLS
ID,"Š—“We are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make othersŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Nothing can be done,Š— returned Lanyon; Š—“ask himselfŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“He will not see me,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I am not surprised at that,Š— was the reply.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Some day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this.",RLS
ID,I cannot tell you.,RLS
ID,"And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for GodŠ—Ès sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in GodŠ—Ès name, go, for I cannot bear itŠ—.",RLS
ID,"As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift.",RLS
ID,The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I do not blame our old friend,Š— Jekyll wrote, Š—“but I share his view that we must never meet.",RLS
ID,"I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you.",RLS
ID,You must suffer me to go my own dark way.,RLS
ID,I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name.,RLS
ID,"If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also.",RLS
ID,"I could not think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and that is to respect my silenceŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Utterson was amazed; the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked.",RLS
ID,"So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of LanyonŠ—Ès manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground.",RLS
ID,"A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead.",RLS
ID,"The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend.",RLS
ID,"Š—“PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in case of his predecease to be destroyed unread,Š— so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I have buried one friend to-day,Š— he thought: Š—“what if this should cost me another?",RLS
ID,"Š— And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal.",RLS
ID,"Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as Š—“not to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry JekyllŠ—.",RLS
ID,Utterson could not trust his eyes.,RLS
ID,"Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted.",RLS
ID,"But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.",RLS
ID,"Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean?",RLS
ID,"A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe.",RLS
ID,"It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness.",RLS
ID,He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful.,RLS
ID,"He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse.",RLS
ID,"Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate.",RLS
ID,"The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind.",RLS
ID,"Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits.",RLS
ID,"INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW   It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well,Š— said Enfield, Š—“that storyŠ—Ès at an end at least.",RLS
ID,We shall never see more of Mr. HydeŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I hope not,Š— said Utterson.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Did I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“It was impossible to do the one without the other,Š— returned Enfield.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. JekyllŠ—Ès!",RLS
ID,"It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I didŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“So you found it out, did you?",RLS
ID,Š— said Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Š—“But if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows.",RLS
ID,"To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him goodŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with sunset.",RLS
ID,"The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.",RLS
ID,Š—“What!,RLS
ID,Jekyll!,RLS
ID,Š— he cried.,RLS
ID,Š—“I trust you are betterŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I am very low, Utterson,Š— replied the doctor drearily, Š—“very low.",RLS
ID,"It will not last long, thank GodŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“You stay too much indoors,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me.",RLS
ID,(This is my cousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.,RLS
ID,) Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with usŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“You are very good,Š— sighed the other.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not.",RLS
ID,"But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fitŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Why, then,Š— said the lawyer, good-naturedly, Š—“the best thing we can do is to stay down here and speak with you from where we areŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“That is just what I was about to venture to propose,Š— returned the doctor with a smile.",RLS
ID,"But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below.",RLS
ID,"They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a word.",RLS
ID,"In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.",RLS
ID,They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.,RLS
ID,"Š—“God forgive us, God forgive us,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence.",RLS
ID,"THE LAST NIGHT   Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?",RLS
ID,"Š— he cried; and then taking a second look at him, Š—“What ails you?",RLS
ID,Š— he added; Š—“is the doctor ill?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Mr. Utterson,Š— said the man, Š—“there is something wrongŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you wantŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“You know the doctorŠ—Ès ways, sir,Š— replied Poole, Š—“and how he shuts himself up.",RLS
ID,"Well, heŠ—Ès shut up again in the cabinet; and I donŠ—Èt like it, sir--I wish I may die if I like it.",RLS
ID,"Mr. Utterson, sir, IŠ—Èm afraidŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Now, my good man,Š— said the lawyer, Š—“be explicit.",RLS
ID,What are you afraid of?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“IŠ—Ève been afraid for about a week,Š— returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, Š—“and I can bear it no moreŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The manŠ—Ès appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face.",RLS
ID,"Even now, he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of the floor.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I can bear it no more,Š— he repeated.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Come,Š— said the lawyer, Š—“I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss.",RLS
ID,Try to tell me what it isŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I think thereŠ—Ès been foul play,Š— said Poole, hoarsely.",RLS
ID,Š—“Foul play!,RLS
ID,"Š— cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to be irritated in consequence.",RLS
ID,Š—“What foul play!,RLS
ID,What does the man mean?,RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“I darenŠ—Èt say, sir,Š— was the answer; Š—“but will you come along with me and see for yourself?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Mr. UttersonŠ—Ès only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared upon the butlerŠ—Ès face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow.",RLS
ID,"It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture.",RLS
ID,"The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face.",RLS
ID,"It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted.",RLS
ID,"He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity.",RLS
ID,"The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing.",RLS
ID,"Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief.",RLS
ID,"But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well, sir,Š— he said, Š—“here we are, and God grant there be nothing wrongŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Amen, Poole,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, Š—“Is that you, Poole?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“ItŠ—Ès all right,Š— said Poole.",RLS
ID,Š—“Open the doorŠ—.,RLS
ID,"The hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep.",RLS
ID,"At the sight of Mr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying out Š—“Bless God!",RLS
ID,"itŠ—Ès Mr. Utterson,Š— ran forward as if to take him in her arms.",RLS
ID,"Š—“What, what?",RLS
ID,Are you all here?,RLS
ID,Š— said the lawyer peevishly.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleasedŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“TheyŠ—Ère all afraid,Š— said Poole.",RLS
ID,"Blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her voice and now wept loudly.",RLS
ID,Š—“Hold your tongue!,RLS
ID,"Š— Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And now,Š— continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, Š—“reach me a candle, and weŠ—Èll get this through hands at onceŠ—.",RLS
ID,"And then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Now, sir,Š— said he, Š—“you come as gently as you can.",RLS
ID,"I want you to hear, and I donŠ—Èt want you to be heard.",RLS
ID,"And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, donŠ—Èt goŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Mr. UttersonŠ—Ès nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage and followed the butler into the laboratory building through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of the stair.",RLS
ID,"Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,Š— he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.",RLS
ID,"A voice answered from within: Š—“Tell him I cannot see anyone,Š— it said complainingly.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Thank you, sir,Š— said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Sir,Š— he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, Š—“Was that my masterŠ—Ès voice?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“It seems much changed,Š— replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look.",RLS
ID,Š—“Changed?,RLS
ID,"Well, yes, I think so,Š— said the butler.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Have I been twenty years in this manŠ—Ès house, to be deceived about his voice?",RLS
ID,"No, sir; masterŠ—Ès made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and whoŠ—Ès in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,Š—  said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Suppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been--well, murdered what could induce the murderer to stay?",RLS
ID,That wonŠ—Èt hold water; it doesnŠ—Èt commend itself to reasonŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but IŠ—Èll do it yet,Š—  said Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind.",RLS
ID,"It was sometimes his way--the masterŠ—Ès, that is--to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair.",RLS
ID,"WeŠ—Ève had nothing else this week back; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking.",RLS
ID,"Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town.",RLS
ID,"Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm.",RLS
ID,"This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever forŠ—.",RLS
ID,Š—“Have you any of these papers?,RLS
ID,Š— asked Mr. Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined.",RLS
ID,Its contents ran thus: Š—“Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs.,RLS
ID,Maw.,RLS
ID,He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose.,RLS
ID,"In the year 18--, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs.",RLS
ID,"M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at once.",RLS
ID,Expense is no consideration.,RLS
ID,The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggeratedŠ—.,RLS
ID,"So far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writerŠ—Ès emotion had broken loose.",RLS
ID,"Š—“For GodŠ—Ès sake,Š— he added, Š—“find me some of the oldŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This is a strange note,Š— said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, Š—“How do you come to have it open?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“The man at MawŠ—Ès was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,Š— returned Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This is unquestionably the doctorŠ—Ès hand, do you know?",RLS
ID,Š— resumed the lawyer.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I thought it looked like it,Š— said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, Š—“But what matters hand of write?",RLS
ID,Š— he said.,RLS
ID,Š—“IŠ—Ève seen him!,RLS
ID,Š—  Š—“Seen him?,RLS
ID,Š— repeated Mr. Utterson.,RLS
ID,Š—“Well?,RLS
ID,Š—  Š—“ThatŠ—Ès it!,RLS
ID,Š— said Poole.,RLS
ID,Š—“It was this way.,RLS
ID,I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden.,RLS
ID,"It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates.",RLS
ID,"He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.",RLS
ID,"It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills.",RLS
ID,"Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face?",RLS
ID,"If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from me?",RLS
ID,I have served him long enough.,RLS
ID,And then.,RLS
ID,.,RLS
ID,Š—.,RLS
ID,The man paused and passed his hand over his face.,RLS
ID,"Š—“These are all very strange circumstances,Š— said Mr. Utterson, Š—“but I think I begin to see daylight.",RLS
ID,"Your master, Poole, is plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer; hence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery--God grant that he be not deceived!",RLS
ID,"There is my explanation; it is sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant alarmsŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Sir,Š— said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, Š—“that thing was not my master, and thereŠ—Ès the truth.",RLS
ID,"My masterŠ—--here he looked round him and began to whisper--Š—“is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarfŠ—.",RLS
ID,Utterson attempted to protest.,RLS
ID,"Š—“O, sir,Š—  cried Poole, Š—“do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?",RLS
ID,"Do you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life?",RLS
ID,"No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr. Jekyll--God knows what it was, but it was never Dr. Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder doneŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Poole,Š— replied the lawyer, Š—“if you say that, it will become my duty to make certain.",RLS
ID,"Much as I desire to spare your masterŠ—Ès feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that doorŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Ah, Mr. Utterson, thatŠ—Ès talking!",RLS
ID,Š— cried the butler.,RLS
ID,"Š—“And now comes the second question,Š— resumed Utterson: Š—“Who is going to do it?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Why, you and me, sir,Š— was the undaunted reply.",RLS
ID,"Š—“ThatŠ—Ès very well said,Š— returned the lawyer; Š—“and whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loserŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“There is an axe in the theatre,Š— continued Poole; Š—“and you might take the kitchen poker for yourselfŠ—.",RLS
ID,"The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Do you know, Poole,Š— he said, looking up, Š—“that you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“You may say so, sir, indeed,Š— returned the butler.",RLS
ID,"Š—“It is well, then that we should be frank,Š— said the other.",RLS
ID,Š—“We both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast.,RLS
ID,"This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that,Š— was the answer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“But if you mean, was it Mr. Hyde?",RLS
ID,"--why, yes, I think it was!",RLS
ID,"You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door?",RLS
ID,"You have not forgot, sir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him?",RLS
ID,But thatŠ—Ès not all.,RLS
ID,"I donŠ—Èt know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Yes,Š— said the lawyer, Š—“I once spoke with himŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman--something that gave a man a turn--I donŠ—Èt know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your marrow kind of cold and thinŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I own I felt something of what you describe,Š— said Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Quite so, sir,Š— returned Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Well, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice.",RLS
ID,"O, I know itŠ—Ès not evidence, Mr. Utterson; IŠ—Èm book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Ay, ay,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,Š—“My fears incline to the same point.,RLS
ID,"Evil, I fear, founded--evil was sure to come--of that connection.",RLS
ID,"Ay truly, I believe you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer (for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victimŠ—Ès room.",RLS
ID,"Well, let our name be vengeance.",RLS
ID,Call BradshawŠ—.,RLS
ID,"The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Put yourself together, Bradshaw,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This suspense, I know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make an end of it.",RLS
ID,"Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the cabinet.",RLS
ID,"If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the blame.",RLS
ID,"Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory door.",RLS
ID,"We give you ten minutes, to get to your stationsŠ—.",RLS
ID,"As Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And now, Poole, let us get to ours,Š— he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the way into the yard.",RLS
ID,"The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite dark.",RLS
ID,"The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait.",RLS
ID,"London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.",RLS
ID,"Š—“So it will walk all day, sir,Š— whispered Poole; Š—“ay, and the better part of the night.",RLS
ID,"Only when a new sample comes from the chemist, thereŠ—Ès a bit of a break.",RLS
ID,"Ah, itŠ—Ès an ill conscience thatŠ—Ès such an enemy to rest!",RLS
ID,"Ah, sir, thereŠ—Ès blood foully shed in every step of it!",RLS
ID,"But hark again, a little closer--put your heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctorŠ—Ès foot?",RLS
ID,"Š—  The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,Utterson sighed.,RLS
ID,Š—“Is there never anything else?,RLS
ID,Š— he asked.,RLS
ID,Poole nodded.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Once,Š— he said.",RLS
ID,Š—“Once I heard it weeping!,RLS
ID,Š—  Š—“Weeping?,RLS
ID,how that?,RLS
ID,"Š— said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,Š— said the butler.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept tooŠ—.",RLS
ID,But now the ten minutes drew to an end.,RLS
ID,"Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Jekyll,Š— cried Utterson, with a loud voice, Š—“I demand to see youŠ—.",RLS
ID,"He paused a moment, but there came no reply.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I give you fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,Š— he resumed; Š—“if not by fair means, then by foul--if not of your consent, then by brute force!",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Utterson,Š— said the voice, Š—“for GodŠ—Ès sake, have mercy!",RLS
ID,"Š—  Š—“Ah, thatŠ—Ès not JekyllŠ—Ès voice--itŠ—Ès HydeŠ—Ès!",RLS
ID,Š— cried Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Down with the door, Poole!",RLS
ID,"Š—  Poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges.",RLS
ID,"A dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet.",RLS
ID,"Up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.",RLS
ID,"The besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had succeeded, stood back a little and peered in.",RLS
ID,"There lay the cabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and chattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer or two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer the fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would have said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most commonplace that night in London.",RLS
ID,Right in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and still twitching.,RLS
ID,"They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,"He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctorŠ—Ès bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.",RLS
ID,"Š—“We have come too late,Š— he said sternly, Š—“whether to save or punish.",RLS
ID,Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your masterŠ—.,RLS
ID,"The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court.",RLS
ID,A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs.,RLS
ID,There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar.,RLS
ID,All these they now thoroughly examined.,RLS
ID,"Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened.",RLS
ID,"The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was JekyllŠ—Ès predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.",RLS
ID,No where was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.,RLS
ID,Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor.,RLS
ID,"Š—“He must be buried here,Š— he said, hearkening to the sound.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Or he may have fled,Š— said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street.",RLS
ID,"It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This does not look like use,Š— observed the lawyer.",RLS
ID,Š—“Use!,RLS
ID,Š— echoed Poole.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Do you not see, sir, it is broken?",RLS
ID,much as if a man had stamped on itŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Ay,Š— continued Utterson, Š—“and the fractures, too, are rustyŠ—.",RLS
ID,The two men looked at each other with a scare.,RLS
ID,"Š—“This is beyond me, Poole,Š— said the lawyer.",RLS
ID,Š—“Let us go back to the cabinetŠ—.,RLS
ID,"They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet.",RLS
ID,"At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented.",RLS
ID,"Š—“That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,Š— said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.",RLS
ID,"This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitterŠ—Ès elbow, the very sugar in the cup.",RLS
ID,"There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.",RLS
ID,"Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror.",RLS
ID,"But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.",RLS
ID,"Š—“This glass has seen some strange things, sir,Š— whispered Poole.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And surely none stranger than itself,Š— echoed the lawyer in the same tones.",RLS
ID,"Š—“For what did JekyllŠ—--he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness--Š—“what could Jekyll want with it?",RLS
ID,Š— he said.,RLS
ID,Š—“You may say that!,RLS
ID,Š— said Poole.,RLS
ID,Next they turned to the business table.,RLS
ID,"On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctorŠ—Ès hand, the name of Mr. Utterson.",RLS
ID,"The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor.",RLS
ID,"The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson.",RLS
ID,"He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.",RLS
ID,"Š—“My head goes round,Š— he said.",RLS
ID,Š—“He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this documentŠ—.,RLS
ID,He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctorŠ—Ès hand and dated at the top.,RLS
ID,Š—“O Poole!,RLS
ID,"Š— the lawyer cried, Š—“he was alive and here this day.",RLS
ID,"He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled!",RLS
ID,"And then, why fled?",RLS
ID,and how?,RLS
ID,"and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide?",RLS
ID,"O, we must be careful.",RLS
ID,I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastropheŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Why donŠ—Èt you read it, sir?",RLS
ID,Š— asked Poole.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Because I fear,Š— replied the lawyer solemnly.",RLS
ID,Š—“God grant I have no cause for it!,RLS
ID,"Š— And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows:  Š—“My dear Utterson,--When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early.",RLS
ID,"Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of  Š—“Your unworthy and unhappy friend,  Š—“HENRY JEKYLLŠ—.",RLS
ID,Š—“There was a third enclosure?,RLS
ID,Š— asked Utterson.,RLS
ID,"Š—“Here, sir,Š— said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places.",RLS
ID,The lawyer put it in his pocket.,RLS
ID,Š—“I would say nothing of this paper.,RLS
ID,"If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit.",RLS
ID,"It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the policeŠ—.",RLS
ID,"They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.",RLS
ID,DR.,RLS
ID,"LANYONŠ—ÈS NARRATIVE   On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school companion, Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,"I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration.",RLS
ID,"The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:  Š—“10th December, 18--.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Dear Lanyon,--You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection.",RLS
ID,"There was never a day when, if you had said to me, `Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,Š—È I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.",RLS
ID,"Lanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost.",RLS
ID,"You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant.",RLS
ID,Judge for yourself.,RLS
ID,"Š—“I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night--ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house.",RLS
ID,"Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith.",RLS
ID,"The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom.",RLS
ID,"In my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book.",RLS
ID,This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.,RLS
ID,Š—“That is the first part of the service: now for the second.,RLS
ID,"You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do.",RLS
ID,"At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet.",RLS
ID,Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely.,RLS
ID,"Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.",RLS
ID,"Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told.",RLS
ID,"Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save  Š—“Your friend,  Š—“H.J.  Š—“P.S.--I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul.",RLS
ID,"It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning.",RLS
ID,"In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight.",RLS
ID,"It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry JekyllŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested.",RLS
ID,"The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility.",RLS
ID,"I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to JekyllŠ—Ès house.",RLS
ID,"The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter.",RLS
ID,"The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. DenmanŠ—Ès surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) JekyllŠ—Ès private cabinet is most conveniently entered.",RLS
ID,"The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair.",RLS
ID,"But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hourŠ—Ès work, the door stood open.",RLS
ID,"The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square.",RLS
ID,Here I proceeded to examine its contents.,RLS
ID,"The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of JekyllŠ—Ès private manufacture: and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour.",RLS
ID,"The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether.",RLS
ID,At the other ingredients I could make no guess.,RLS
ID,The book was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of dates.,RLS
ID,"These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly.",RLS
ID,"Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single word: Š—“doubleŠ— occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, Š—“total failure!",RLS
ID,!,RLS
ID,!,RLS
ID,"Š— All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite.",RLS
ID,"Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of JekyllŠ—Ès investigations) to no end of practical usefulness.",RLS
ID,"How could the presence of these articles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague?",RLS
ID,"If his messenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another?",RLS
ID,"And even granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by me in secret?",RLS
ID,"The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.",RLS
ID,"Twelve oŠ—Èclock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door.",RLS
ID,"I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico.",RLS
ID,Š—“Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?,RLS
ID,Š— I asked.,RLS
ID,"He told me Š—“yesŠ— by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the darkness of the square.",RLS
ID,"There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bullŠ—Ès eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste.",RLS
ID,"These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon.",RLS
ID,"Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him.",RLS
ID,"I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain.",RLS
ID,"He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and--last but not least--with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood.",RLS
ID,"This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse.",RLS
ID,"At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred.",RLS
ID,"This person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement--the trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders.",RLS
ID,"Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter.",RLS
ID,"Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced me--something seizing, surprising and revolting--this fresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest in the manŠ—Ès nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the world.",RLS
ID,"These observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set down in, were yet the work of a few seconds.",RLS
ID,"My visitor was, indeed, on fire with sombre excitement.",RLS
ID,Š—“Have you got it?,RLS
ID,Š— he cried.,RLS
ID,Š—“Have you got it?,RLS
ID,Š— And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me.,RLS
ID,"I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Come, sir,Š— said I. Š—“You forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance.",RLS
ID,"Be seated, if you pleaseŠ—.",RLS
ID,"And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster.",RLS
ID,"Š—“I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,Š— he replied civilly enough.",RLS
ID,Š—“What you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my politeness.,RLS
ID,"I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood.",RLS
ID,.,RLS
ID,Š—.,RLS
ID,"He paused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the hysteria--Š—“I understood, a drawer.",RLS
ID,.,RLS
ID,Š—.,RLS
ID,"But here I took pity on my visitorŠ—Ès suspense, and some perhaps on my own growing curiosity.",RLS
ID,"Š—“There it is, sir,Š— said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.",RLS
ID,"He sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and reason.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Compose yourself,Š— said I.  He turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of despair, plucked away the sheet.",RLS
ID,"At sight of the contents, he uttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified.",RLS
ID,"And the next moment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, Š—“Have you a graduated glass?",RLS
ID,Š— he asked.,RLS
ID,I rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he asked.,RLS
ID,"He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders.",RLS
ID,"The mixture, which was at first of a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to brighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes of vapour.",RLS
ID,"Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and the compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to a watery green.",RLS
ID,"My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a keen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.",RLS
ID,"Š—“And now,Š— said he, Š—“to settle what remains.",RLS
ID,Will you be wise?,RLS
ID,will you be guided?,RLS
ID,will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go forth from your house without further parley?,RLS
ID,or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you?,RLS
ID,"Think before you answer, for it shall be done as you decide.",RLS
ID,"As you decide, you shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul.",RLS
ID,"Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of SatanŠ—.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Sir,Š— said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, Š—“you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief.",RLS
ID,But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the endŠ—.,RLS
ID,"Š—“It is well,Š— replied my visitor.",RLS
ID,"Š—“Lanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession.",RLS
ID,"And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors--behold!",RLS
ID,Š—  He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp.,RLS
ID,"A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.",RLS
ID,Š—“O God!,RLS
ID,"Š— I screamed, and Š—“O God!",RLS
ID,"Š— again and again; for there before my eyes--pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death--there stood Henry Jekyll!",RLS
ID,"What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper.",RLS
ID,"I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if I believe it, and I cannot answer.",RLS
ID,"My life is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die; and yet I shall die incredulous.",RLS
ID,"As for the moral turpitude that man unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I can not, even in memory, dwell on it without a start of horror.",RLS
ID,"I will say but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough.",RLS
ID,"The creature who crept into my house that night was, on JekyllŠ—Ès own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.",RLS
ID,"HASTIE LANYON     HENRY JEKYLLŠ—ÈS FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE   I was born in the year 18-- to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future.",RLS
ID,"And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public.",RLS
ID,"Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life.",RLS
ID,"Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame.",RLS
ID,"It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound manŠ—Ès dual nature.",RLS
ID,"In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress.",RLS
ID,"Though so profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering.",RLS
ID,"And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members.",RLS
ID,"With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two.",RLS
ID,"I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point.",RLS
ID,"Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens.",RLS
ID,"I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only.",RLS
ID,"It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements.",RLS
ID,"If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil.",RLS
ID,"It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together--that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.",RLS
ID,"How, then were they dissociated?",RLS
ID,"I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table.",RLS
ID,"I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired.",RLS
ID,"Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion.",RLS
ID,"For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession.",RLS
ID,"First, because I have been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on manŠ—Ès shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressure.",RLS
ID,"Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas!",RLS
ID,"too evident, my discoveries were incomplete.",RLS
ID,"Enough then, that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul.",RLS
ID,I hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice.,RLS
ID,"I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change.",RLS
ID,But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm.,RLS
ID,"I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments, to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I compounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion.",RLS
ID,"The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death.",RLS
ID,"Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness.",RLS
ID,"There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet.",RLS
ID,"I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul.",RLS
ID,"I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine.",RLS
ID,"I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.",RLS
ID,"There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations.",RLS
ID,"The night however, was far gone into the morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day--the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom.",RLS
ID,"I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,"I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable.",RLS
ID,"The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed.",RLS
ID,"Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted.",RLS
ID,"And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,"Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other.",RLS
ID,Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay.,RLS
ID,"And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome.",RLS
ID,"This, too, was myself.",RLS
ID,It seemed natural and human.,RLS
ID,"In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine.",RLS
ID,And in so far I was doubtless right.,RLS
ID,"I have observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh.",RLS
ID,"This, as I take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.",RLS
ID,"I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,That night I had come to the fatal cross-roads.,RLS
ID,"Had I approached my discovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth an angel instead of a fiend.",RLS
ID,"The drug had no discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that which stood within ran forth.",RLS
ID,"At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,"Hence, although I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair.",RLS
ID,The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.,RLS
ID,"Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study.",RLS
ID,"I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome.",RLS
ID,It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery.,RLS
ID,"I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,I smiled at the notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations with the most studious care.,RLS
ID,"I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous.",RLS
ID,"On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in my second character.",RLS
ID,"I next drew up that will to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss.",RLS
ID,"And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position.",RLS
ID,"Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter.",RLS
ID,I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures.,RLS
ID,"I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty.",RLS
ID,"But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete.",RLS
ID,Think of it--I did not even exist!,RLS
ID,"Let me but escape into my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,"The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term.",RLS
ID,"But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous.",RLS
ID,"When I would come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity.",RLS
ID,"This familiar that I called out of my own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone.",RLS
ID,"Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience.",RLS
ID,"It was Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.",RLS
ID,"Jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde.",RLS
ID,And thus his conscience slumbered.,RLS
ID,Into the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I mean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which my chastisement approached.,RLS
ID,"I met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention.",RLS
ID,"An act of cruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the childŠ—Ès family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll.",RLS
ID,"But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.",RLS
ID,"Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations.",RLS
ID,"It was in vain I looked about me; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,"I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze.",RLS
ID,"I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand.",RLS
ID,"Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white and comely.",RLS
ID,"But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair.",RLS
ID,It was the hand of Edward Hyde.,RLS
ID,"I must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror.",RLS
ID,"At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin and icy.",RLS
ID,"Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,How was this to be explained?,RLS
ID,"I asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror--how was it to be remedied?",RLS
ID,"It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my drugs were in the cabinet--a long journey down two pairs of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and through the anatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck.",RLS
ID,"It might indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that, when I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature?",RLS
ID,"And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self.",RLS
ID,"I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.",RLS
ID,Small indeed was my appetite.,RLS
ID,"This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence.",RLS
ID,"That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine.",RLS
ID,The power of the drug had not been always equally displayed.,RLS
ID,"Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.",RLS
ID,"Now, however, and in the light of that morningŠ—Ès accident, I was led to remark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itself to the other side.",RLS
ID,"All things therefore seemed to point to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.",RLS
ID,"Between these two, I now felt I had to choose.",RLS
ID,"My two natures had memory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared between them.",RLS
ID,"Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive apprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself from pursuit.",RLS
ID,Jekyll had more than a fatherŠ—Ès interest; Hyde had more than a sonŠ—Ès indifference.,RLS
ID,"To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper.",RLS
ID,"To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless.",RLS
ID,"The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost.",RLS
ID,"Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it.",RLS
ID,"Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde.",RLS
ID,"I made this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet.",RLS
ID,"For two months, however, I was true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an approving conscience.",RLS
ID,"But time began at last to obliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught.",RLS
ID,"I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde.",RLS
ID,Yet it was by these that I was punished.,RLS
ID,"My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring.",RLS
ID,"I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill.",RLS
ID,"It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything.",RLS
ID,"But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.",RLS
ID,Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged.,RLS
ID,"With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror.",RLS
ID,"A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost peg.",RLS
ID,"I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.",RLS
ID,"Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man.",RLS
ID,"The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God.",RLS
ID,The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot.,RLS
ID,"I saw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my fatherŠ—Ès hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening.",RLS
ID,"I could have screamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul.",RLS
ID,"As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy.",RLS
ID,The problem of my conduct was solved.,RLS
ID,"Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it!",RLS
ID,with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life!,RLS
ID,"with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel!",RLS
ID,"The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation.",RLS
ID,"It was not only a crime, it had been a tragic folly.",RLS
ID,I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the scaffold.,RLS
ID,"Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.",RLS
ID,I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good.,RLS
ID,"You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself.",RLS
ID,"Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl for licence.",RLS
ID,"Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of temptation.",RLS
ID,There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the balance of my soul.,RLS
ID,"And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before I had made my discovery.",RLS
ID,"It was a fine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and the RegentŠ—Ès Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours.",RLS
ID,"I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin.",RLS
ID,"After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect.",RLS
ID,"And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering.",RLS
ID,"These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation.",RLS
ID,I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and hairy.,RLS
ID,I was once more Edward Hyde.,RLS
ID,"A moment before I had been safe of all menŠ—Ès respect, wealthy, beloved--the cloth laying for me in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.",RLS
ID,"My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly.",RLS
ID,"I have more than once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment.",RLS
ID,My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was I to reach them?,RLS
ID,That was the problem that (crushing my temples in my hands) I set myself to solve.,RLS
ID,The laboratory door I had closed.,RLS
ID,"If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows.",RLS
ID,"I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon.",RLS
ID,How was he to be reached?,RLS
ID,how persuaded?,RLS
ID,"Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence?",RLS
ID,"and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll?",RLS
ID,"Then I remembered that of my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from end to end.",RLS
ID,"Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember.",RLS
ID,"At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth.",RLS
ID,"I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face--happily for him--yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch.",RLS
ID,"At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write.",RLS
ID,"Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain.",RLS
ID,"Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered.",RLS
ID,"Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city.",RLS
ID,"He, I say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred.",RLS
ID,"And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest.",RLS
ID,"He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from midnight.",RLS
ID,"Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights.",RLS
ID,"He smote her in the face, and she fled.",RLS
ID,"When I came to myself at LanyonŠ—Ès, the horror of my old friend perhaps affected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours.",RLS
ID,A change had come over me.,RLS
ID,"It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me.",RLS
ID,I received LanyonŠ—Ès condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed.,RLS
ID,"I slept after the prostration of the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung me could avail to break.",RLS
ID,"I awoke in the morning shaken, weakened, but refreshed.",RLS
ID,"I still hated and feared the thought of the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope.",RLS
ID,"I was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde.",RLS
ID,It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas!,RLS
ID,"six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered.",RLS
ID,"In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll.",RLS
ID,"At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened.",RLS
ID,"Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self.",RLS
ID,"But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to contain the raging energies of life.",RLS
ID,The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll.,RLS
ID,And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side.,RLS
ID,"With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct.",RLS
ID,"He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic.",RLS
ID,"This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life.",RLS
ID,"And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life.",RLS
ID,The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order.,RLS
ID,"His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded.",RLS
ID,"Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin.",RLS
ID,"But his love of me is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.",RLS
ID,"It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought--no, not alleviation--but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and nature.",RLS
ID,"My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the first experiment, began to run low.",RLS

ID,"I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out.",BXS

ID,"Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--""gotza"" they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.",BXS
ID,"I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily.",BXS
ID,"Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road.",BXS
ID,"There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.",BXS
ID,"In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the ""Mittel Land"" ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame.",BXS
ID,"The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.",BXS
ID,"I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund.",BXS
ID,"I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows.",BXS
ID,"In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order.",BXS
ID,"Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.",BXS
ID,Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.,BXS
ID,"Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly.",BXS
ID,"Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water.",BXS
ID,"One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:--  ""Look!",BXS
ID,"Isten szek""!",BXS
ID,"--""God's seat""!",BXS
ID,"As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.",BXS
ID,"This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.",BXS
ID,"Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.",BXS
ID,"By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves.",BXS
ID,"Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world.",BXS
ID,"There were many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.",BXS
ID,"Now and again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road.",BXS
ID,"On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves, with axe at end.",BXS
ID,"As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow.",BXS
ID,"Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys.",BXS
ID,"Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could only go slowly.",BXS
ID,"I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it.",BXS
ID,"""No, no,"" he said; ""you must not walk here; the dogs are too fierce""; and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest--""and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep"".",BXS
ID,The only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.,BXS
ID,"When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed.",BXS
ID,"He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions.",BXS
ID,"Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills.",BXS
ID,"The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea.",BXS
ID,I had to hold on.,BXS
ID,"The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along.",BXS
ID,Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass.,BXS
ID,"One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.",BXS
ID,"Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness.",BXS
ID,"It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation.",BXS
ID,This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side.,BXS
ID,"There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder.",BXS
ID,"It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one.",BXS
ID,I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count.,BXS
ID,Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark.,BXS
ID,"The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.",BXS
ID,"We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.",BXS
ID,"The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.",BXS
ID,"I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was ""An hour less than the time"".",BXS
ID,"Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own:--  ""There is no carriage here.",BXS
ID,The Herr is not expected after all.,BXS
ID,"He will now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better the next day"".",BXS
ID,"Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up.",BXS
ID,"Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calíÂche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.",BXS
ID,"I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals.",BXS
ID,"They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us.",BXS
ID,"I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us.",BXS
ID,"He said to the driver:--  ""You are early to-night, my friend"".",BXS
ID,"The man stammered in reply:--  ""The English Herr was in a hurry,"" to which the stranger replied:--  ""That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina.",BXS
ID,"You cannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift"".",BXS
ID,"As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.",BXS
ID,"One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's ""Lenore"":--      ""Denn die Todten reiten schnell""--     (""For the dead travel fast"".",BXS
ID,")  The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile.",BXS
ID,"The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself.",BXS
ID,"""Give me the Herr's luggage,"" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calíÂche.",BXS
ID,"Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calíÂche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been prodigious.",BXS
ID,"Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass.",BXS
ID,"As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves.",BXS
ID,"Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina.",BXS
ID,"As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:--  ""The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you.",BXS
ID,"There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it"".",BXS
ID,"I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same.",BXS
ID,"I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened.",BXS
ID,"I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey.",BXS
ID,"The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road.",BXS
ID,"It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so.",BXS
ID,"I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay.",BXS
ID,"By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was within a few minutes of midnight.",BXS
ID,"This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences.",BXS
ID,I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.,BXS
ID,"Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear.",BXS
ID,"The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night.",BXS
ID,"At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright.",BXS
ID,"Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to jump from the calíÂche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting.",BXS
ID,"In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them.",BXS
ID,"He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled.",BXS
ID,"The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.",BXS
ID,"This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.",BXS
ID,"Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.",BXS
ID,"Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.",BXS
ID,"It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket.",BXS
ID,"The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way.",BXS
ID,"The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side.",BXS
ID,"I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear.",BXS
ID,"The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame.",BXS
ID,"The driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.",BXS
ID,"I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey.",BXS
ID,"I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.",BXS
ID,"Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions.",BXS
ID,"He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device.",BXS
ID,"Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.",BXS
ID,"This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness.",BXS
ID,"Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.",BXS
ID,"At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright.",BXS
ID,"I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.",BXS
ID,They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.,BXS
ID,"For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.",BXS
ID,It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.,BXS
ID,All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them.,BXS
ID,"The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see; but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they had perforce to remain within it.",BXS
ID,"I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach.",BXS
ID,"I shouted and beat the side of the calíÂche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap.",BXS
ID,"How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.",BXS
ID,"As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still.",BXS
ID,"Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.",BXS
ID,"When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calíÂche, and the wolves had disappeared.",BXS
ID,"This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.",BXS
ID,"The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.",BXS
ID,"We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.",BXS
ID,"I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place.",BXS
ID,"In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is.",BXS
ID,I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.,BXS
ID,"When the calíÂche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight.",BXS
ID,Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength.,BXS
ID,His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen.,BXS
ID,"Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone.",BXS
ID,"I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather.",BXS
ID,"As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings.",BXS
ID,"I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.",BXS
ID,Of bell or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate.,BXS
ID,"The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me.",BXS
ID,"What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?",BXS
ID,What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?,BXS
ID,Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner?,BXS
ID,Solicitor's clerk!,BXS
ID,Mina would not like that.,BXS
ID,Solicitor--for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a full-blown solicitor!,BXS
ID,I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake.,BXS
ID,"It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork.",BXS
ID,"But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived.",BXS
ID,I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians.,BXS
ID,"All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning.",BXS
ID,"Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light.",BXS
ID,Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back.,BXS
ID,"A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back.",BXS
ID,"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere.",BXS
ID,"He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door.",BXS
ID,"The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--  ""Welcome to my house!",BXS
ID,"Enter freely and of your own will""!",BXS
ID,"He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.",BXS
ID,"The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man.",BXS
ID,"Again he said:--  ""Welcome to my house.",BXS
ID,Come freely.,BXS
ID,"Go safely; and leave something of the happiness you bring""!",BXS
ID,"The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--  ""Count Dracula""?",BXS
ID,"He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--  ""I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house.",BXS
ID,"Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest"".",BXS
ID,"As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him.",BXS
ID,"I protested but he insisted:--  ""Nay, sir, you are my guest.",BXS
ID,"It is late, and my people are not available.",BXS
ID,"Let me see to your comfort myself"".",BXS
ID,"He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily.",BXS
ID,"At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.",BXS
ID,"The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.",BXS
ID,"Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.",BXS
ID,"It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney.",BXS
ID,"The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door:--  ""You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet.",BXS
ID,I trust you will find all you wish.,BXS
ID,"When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared"".",BXS
ID,The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears.,BXS
ID,"Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room.",BXS
ID,I found supper already laid out.,BXS
ID,"My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said:--  ""I pray you, be seated and sup how you please.",BXS
ID,"You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup"".",BXS
ID,I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.,BXS
ID,"He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read.",BXS
ID,"One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.",BXS
ID,"""I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence.",BXS
ID,"He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition.",BXS
ID,"He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service.",BXS
ID,"He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters"".",BXS
ID,"The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.",BXS
ID,"This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper.",BXS
ID,"During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced.",BXS
ID,"By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke.",BXS
ID,"I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.",BXS
ID,"His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere.",BXS
ID,"His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion.",BXS
ID,"The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years.",BXS
ID,"For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin.",BXS
ID,The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.,BXS
ID,"Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse--broad, with squat fingers.",BXS
ID,"Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm.",BXS
ID,"The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point.",BXS
ID,"As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder.",BXS
ID,"It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal.",BXS
ID,"The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace.",BXS
ID,We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn.,BXS
ID,There seemed a strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves.,BXS
ID,"The Count's eyes gleamed, and he said:--  ""Listen to them--the children of the night.",BXS
ID,"What music they make""!",BXS
ID,"Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added:--  ""Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter"".",BXS
ID,"Then he rose and said:--  ""But you must be tired.",BXS
ID,"Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you shall sleep as late as you will.",BXS
ID,"I have to be away till the afternoon; so sleep well and dream well""!",BXS
ID,"With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom.",BXS
ID,I am all in a sea of wonders.,BXS
ID,"I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.",BXS
ID,"God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me!",BXS
ID,"It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twenty-four hours.",BXS
ID,"I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord.",BXS
ID,"When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth.",BXS
ID,"There was a card on the table, on which was written:--  ""I have to be absent for a while.",BXS
ID,Do not wait for me.,BXS
ID,I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal.,BXS
ID,"When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.",BXS
ID,"There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me.",BXS
ID,"The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.",BXS
ID,"The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order.",BXS
ID,"I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten.",BXS
ID,But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.,BXS
ID,"There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair.",BXS
ID,"I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.",BXS
ID,"Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count's permission.",BXS
ID,"There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library.",BXS
ID,"The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.",BXS
ID,"In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers.",BXS
ID,"A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date.",BXS
ID,"The books were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life and customs and manners.",BXS
ID,"There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the ""Red"" and ""Blue"" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the Law List.",BXS
ID,"Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered.",BXS
ID,"He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good night's rest.",BXS
ID,"Then he went on:--  ""I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you.",BXS
ID,"These companions""--and he laid his hand on some of the books--""have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure.",BXS
ID,Through them I have come to know your great England; and to know her is to love her.,BXS
ID,"I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is.",BXS
ID,But alas!,BXS
ID,as yet I only know your tongue through books.,BXS
ID,"To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak"".",BXS
ID,"""But, Count,"" I said, ""you know and speak English thoroughly""!",BXS
ID,He bowed gravely.,BXS
ID,"""I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.",BXS
ID,"True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them"".",BXS
ID,"""Indeed,"" I said, ""you speak excellently"".",BXS
ID,"""Not so,"" he answered.",BXS
ID,"""Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger.",BXS
ID,That is not enough for me.,BXS
ID,"Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me, and I am master.",BXS
ID,"But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not--and to know not is to care not for.",BXS
ID,"I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha!",BXS
ID,a stranger!,BXS
ID,' I have been so long master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should be master of me.,BXS
ID,"You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London.",BXS
ID,"You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking.",BXS
ID,"I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand"".",BXS
ID,"Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose.",BXS
ID,"He answered: ""Yes, certainly,"" and added:--  ""You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go.",BXS
ID,"There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand"".",BXS
ID,"I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:--  ""We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England.",BXS
ID,"Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.",BXS
ID,"Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be"".",BXS
ID,"This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.",BXS
ID,"Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly.",BXS
ID,"Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames.",BXS
ID,"He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed.",BXS
ID,"""That treasure has been hidden,"" he went on, ""in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk.",BXS
ID,"Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders.",BXS
ID,"In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches.",BXS
ID,"When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil"".",BXS
ID,"""But how,"" said I, ""can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look""?",BXS
ID,"The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--  ""Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!",BXS
ID,"Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors.",BXS
ID,"And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do.",BXS
ID,"Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work.",BXS
ID,"Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again""?",BXS
ID,"""There you are right,"" I said.",BXS
ID,"""I know no more than the dead where even to look for them"".",BXS
ID,Then we drifted into other matters.,BXS
ID,"""Come,"" he said at last, ""tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me"".",BXS
ID,"With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag.",BXS
ID,"Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.",BXS
ID,"The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide.",BXS
ID,When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.,BXS
ID,"He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings.",BXS
ID,"He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did.",BXS
ID,"When I remarked this, he answered:--  ""Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?",BXS
ID,"When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me.",BXS
ID,"He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.",BXS
ID,"So""!",BXS
ID,We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet.,BXS
ID,"When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place.",BXS
ID,"I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:--  ""At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale.",BXS
ID,"It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years.",BXS
ID,"The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust.",BXS
ID,"""The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass.",BXS
ID,"It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned.",BXS
ID,"There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized stream.",BXS
ID,"The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to medií_val times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron.",BXS
ID,"It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church.",BXS
ID,"I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points.",BXS
ID,"The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great.",BXS
ID,"There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum.",BXS
ID,"It is not, however, visible from the grounds"".",BXS
ID,"When I had finished, he said:--  ""I am glad that it is old and big.",BXS
ID,"I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me.",BXS
ID,"A house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century.",BXS
ID,I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times.,BXS
ID,We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead.,BXS
ID,"I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay.",BXS
ID,"I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth.",BXS
ID,"Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements.",BXS
ID,"I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may"".",BXS
ID,"Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.",BXS
ID,"Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together.",BXS
ID,"He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me.",BXS
ID,"One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used.",BXS
ID,"On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.",BXS
ID,It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.,BXS
ID,"""Aha""!",BXS
ID,"he said; ""still at your books?",BXS
ID,Good!,BXS
ID,But you must not work always.,BXS
ID,"Come; I am informed that your supper is ready"".",BXS
ID,"He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table.",BXS
ID,"The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home.",BXS
ID,"But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.",BXS
ID,"After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour.",BXS
ID,"I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in every way.",BXS
ID,"I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.",BXS
ID,"They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it.",BXS
ID,"All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--  ""Why, there is the morning again!",BXS
ID,How remiss I am to let you stay up so long.,BXS
ID,"You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,"" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.",BXS
ID,"I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky.",BXS
ID,"So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day.",BXS
ID,"I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy.",BXS
ID,"I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come.",BXS
ID,It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on me; but would that that were all!,BXS
ID,"If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one.",BXS
ID,"I have only the Count to speak with, and he!",BXS
ID,"Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me.",BXS
ID,If it does I am lost.,BXS
ID,Let me say at once how I stand--or seem to.,BXS
ID,"I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up.",BXS
ID,"I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Count's voice saying to me, ""Good-morning"".",BXS
ID,"I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me.",BXS
ID,"In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment.",BXS
ID,"Having answered the Count's salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.",BXS
ID,"This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder.",BXS
ID,But there was no reflection of him in the mirror!,BXS
ID,"The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself.",BXS
ID,"This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin.",BXS
ID,"I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster.",BXS
ID,"When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.",BXS
ID,"I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix.",BXS
ID,"It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.",BXS
ID,"""Take care,"" he said, ""take care how you cut yourself.",BXS
ID,"It is more dangerous than you think in this country"".",BXS
ID,"Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on: ""And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief.",BXS
ID,It is a foul bauble of man's vanity.,BXS
ID,"Away with it""!",BXS
ID,"and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below.",BXS
ID,Then he withdrew without a word.,BXS
ID,"It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.",BXS
ID,"When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere.",BXS
ID,So I breakfasted alone.,BXS
ID,It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.,BXS
ID,He must be a very peculiar man!,BXS
ID,After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle.,BXS
ID,"I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South.",BXS
ID,"The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it.",BXS
ID,The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice.,BXS
ID,A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything!,BXS
ID,"As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.",BXS
ID,Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.,BXS
ID,"But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted.",BXS
ID,In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit.,BXS
ID,"The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!",BXS
ID,When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.,BXS
ID,"I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings.",BXS
ID,"When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap.",BXS
ID,"When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done.",BXS
ID,"I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion.",BXS
ID,Of one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count.,BXS
ID,"He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.",BXS
ID,"So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open.",BXS
ID,"I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.",BXS
ID,"I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned.",BXS
ID,"He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed.",BXS
ID,"This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house.",BXS
ID,"When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.",BXS
ID,"This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here.",BXS
ID,"This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence.",BXS
ID,How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me?,BXS
ID,"What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?",BXS
ID,"Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck!",BXS
ID,for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it.,BXS
ID,It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help.,BXS
ID,"Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort?",BXS
ID,"Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it.",BXS
ID,"In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand.",BXS
ID,"To-night he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way.",BXS
ID,"I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion.",BXS
ID,I have had a long talk with the Count.,BXS
ID,"I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully.",BXS
ID,"In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all.",BXS
ID,"This he afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate.",BXS
ID,"Whenever he spoke of his house he always said ""we,"" and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.",BXS
ID,"I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating.",BXS
ID,It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.,BXS
ID,"He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength.",BXS
ID,"One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:--  ""We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.",BXS
ID,"Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come.",BXS
ID,"Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert.",BXS
ID,"Fools, fools!",BXS
ID,"What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins""?",BXS
ID,He held up his arms.,BXS
ID,"""Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back?",BXS
ID,Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there?,BXS
ID,"And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, 'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.",BXS
ID,"' Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King?",BXS
ID,"When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent?",BXS
ID,Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground?,BXS
ID,This was a Dracula indeed!,BXS
ID,"Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them!",BXS
ID,"Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph!",BXS
ID,They said that he thought only of himself.,BXS
ID,Bah!,BXS
ID,what good are peasants without a leader?,BXS
ID,Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it?,BXS
ID,"Again, when, after the battle of Mohíçcs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free.",BXS
ID,"Ah, young sir, the Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.",BXS
ID,The warlike days are over.,BXS
ID,"Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told"".",BXS
ID,"It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.",BXS
ID,(_Mem.,BXS
ID,"_, this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the ""Arabian Nights,"" for everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet's father.",BXS
ID,")  Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt.",BXS
ID,"I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them.",BXS
ID,Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business.,BXS
ID,"I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn.",BXS
ID,"There was a certain method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.",BXS
ID,"First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more.",BXS
ID,"I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest.",BXS
ID,"He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor.",BXS
ID,"I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said:--  ""I shall illustrate.",BXS
ID,"Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London.",BXS
ID,Good!,BXS
ID,"Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest.",BXS
ID,"Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports""?",BXS
ID,"I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble.",BXS
ID,"""But,"" said he, ""I could be at liberty to direct myself.",BXS
ID,"Is it not so""?",BXS
ID,"""Of course,"" I replied; and ""such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person"".",BXS
ID,"""Good""!",BXS
ID,"he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against.",BXS
ID,"I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee.",BXS
ID,"For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful.",BXS
ID,"When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said:--  ""Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other""?",BXS
ID,"It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.",BXS
ID,"""Then write now, my young friend,"" he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: ""write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now"".",BXS
ID,"""Do you wish me to stay so long""?",BXS
ID,"I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.",BXS
ID,"""I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal.",BXS
ID,"When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.",BXS
ID,I have not stinted.,BXS
ID,"Is it not so""?",BXS
ID,What could I do but bow acceptance?,BXS
ID,"It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice.",BXS
ID,"The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:--  ""I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters.",BXS
ID,"It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them.",BXS
ID,"Is it not so""?",BXS
ID,As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes.,BXS
ID,"They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it.",BXS
ID,"So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it.",BXS
ID,"When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table.",BXS
ID,"Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table.",BXS
ID,"I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.",BXS
ID,"One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No.",BXS
ID,"7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth.",BXS
ID,The second and fourth were unsealed.,BXS
ID,I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move.,BXS
ID,"I sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room.",BXS
ID,"He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--  ""I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening.",BXS
ID,"You will, I hope, find all things as you wish"".",BXS
ID,"At the door he turned, and after a moment's pause said:--  ""Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.",BXS
ID,"It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.",BXS
ID,Be warned!,BXS
ID,"Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe.",BXS
ID,"But if you be not careful in this respect, then""--He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them.",BXS
ID,"I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.",BXS
ID,"I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question.",BXS
ID,I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not.,BXS
ID,I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.,BXS
ID,When he left me I went to my room.,BXS
ID,"After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South.",BXS
ID,"There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard.",BXS
ID,"Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night.",BXS
ID,I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.,BXS
ID,It is destroying my nerve.,BXS
ID,"I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.",BXS
ID,God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place!,BXS
ID,"I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.",BXS
ID,"In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.",BXS
ID,The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew.,BXS
ID,"As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out.",BXS
ID,"The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there.",BXS
ID,"I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.",BXS
ID,What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window.,BXS
ID,"I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms.",BXS
ID,In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying.,BXS
ID,"I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner.",BXS
ID,"But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, _face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings.",BXS
ID,At first I could not believe my eyes.,BXS
ID,"I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion.",BXS
ID,"I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.",BXS
ID,"What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man?",BXS
ID,I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of.,BXS
ID,Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.,BXS
ID,"He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left.",BXS
ID,He vanished into some hole or window.,BXS
ID,"When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight.",BXS
ID,"I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet.",BXS
ID,"I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.",BXS
ID,"They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally.",BXS
ID,"I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone!",BXS
ID,"That key must be in the Count's room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape.",BXS
ID,"I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them.",BXS
ID,"One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten.",BXS
ID,"At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure.",BXS
ID,"I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor.",BXS
ID,"Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter.",BXS
ID,I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down.,BXS
ID,"From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south.",BXS
ID,"On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice.",BXS
ID,"The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured.",BXS
ID,"To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone.",BXS
ID,"This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen.",BXS
ID,"The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth.",BXS
ID,"My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble.",BXS
ID,"Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me.",BXS
ID,"Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.",BXS
ID,It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.,BXS
ID,"And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere ""modernity"" cannot kill.",BXS
ID,"God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced.",BXS
ID,Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.,BXS
ID,"Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already.",BXS
ID,"If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose.",BXS
ID,Great God!,BXS
ID,merciful God!,BXS
ID,"Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed.",BXS
ID,I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me.,BXS
ID,"Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:--      ""My tablets!",BXS
ID,"quick, my tablets!",BXS
ID,"'Tis meet that I put it down,"" etc.",BXS
ID,",  for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.",BXS
ID,The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.,BXS
ID,"The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me.",BXS
ID,I shall fear to doubt what he may say!,BXS
ID,When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy.,BXS
ID,"The Count's warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it.",BXS
ID,"The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider.",BXS
ID,"The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me.",BXS
ID,"I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.",BXS
ID,"I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep.",BXS
ID,"I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.",BXS
ID,I was not alone.,BXS
ID,"The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust.",BXS
ID,"In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner.",BXS
ID,"I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor.",BXS
ID,"They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together.",BXS
ID,"Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon.",BXS
ID,"The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires.",BXS
ID,"I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where.",BXS
ID,All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.,BXS
ID,"There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear.",BXS
ID,"I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.",BXS
ID,"It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.",BXS
ID,"They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips.",BXS
ID,"It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.",BXS
ID,"The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on.",BXS
ID,"One said:--  ""Go on!",BXS
ID,"You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin"".",BXS
ID,"The other added:--  ""He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all"".",BXS
ID,"I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.",BXS
ID,The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me.,BXS
ID,"Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.",BXS
ID,"I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes.",BXS
ID,"The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating.",BXS
ID,"There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.",BXS
ID,Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat.,BXS
ID,"Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck.",BXS
ID,Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer.,BXS
ID,"I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.",BXS
ID,I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating heart.,BXS
ID,"But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning.",BXS
ID,"I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury.",BXS
ID,"As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion.",BXS
ID,But the Count!,BXS
ID,"Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit.",BXS
ID,His eyes were positively blazing.,BXS
ID,"The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them.",BXS
ID,"His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal.",BXS
ID,"With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves.",BXS
ID,"In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--  ""How dare you touch him, any of you?",BXS
ID,How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it?,BXS
ID,"Back, I tell you all!",BXS
ID,This man belongs to me!,BXS
ID,"Beware how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me"".",BXS
ID,"The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--  ""You yourself never loved; you never love""!",BXS
ID,"On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure of fiends.",BXS
ID,"Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper:--  ""Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past.",BXS
ID,Is it not so?,BXS
ID,"Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will.",BXS
ID,Now go!,BXS
ID,go!,BXS
ID,"I must awaken him, for there is work to be done"".",BXS
ID,"""Are we to have nothing to-night""?",BXS
ID,"said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it.",BXS
ID,For answer he nodded his head.,BXS
ID,One of the women jumped forward and opened it.,BXS
ID,"If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a half-smothered child.",BXS
ID,"The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag.",BXS
ID,"There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing.",BXS
ID,"They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.",BXS
ID,"Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.",BXS
ID,I awoke in my own bed.,BXS
ID,"If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here.",BXS
ID,"I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result.",BXS
ID,"To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit.",BXS
ID,"My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details.",BXS
ID,"But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset.",BXS
ID,I must watch for proof.,BXS
ID,"Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact.",BXS
ID,I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked.,BXS
ID,He would have taken or destroyed it.,BXS
ID,"As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.",BXS
ID,"I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I _must_ know the truth.",BXS
ID,When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed.,BXS
ID,It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered.,BXS
ID,"I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.",BXS
ID,"I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.",BXS
ID,I am surely in the toils.,BXS
ID,"Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz.",BXS
ID,"I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger.",BXS
ID,"He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to prolong my opportunities.",BXS
ID,Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape.,BXS
ID,I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him.,BXS
ID,"He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion.",BXS
ID,"I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters.",BXS
ID,"He calculated a minute, and then said:--  ""The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29"".",BXS
ID,I know now the span of my life.,BXS
ID,God help me!,BXS
ID,"There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home.",BXS
ID,"A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard.",BXS
ID,These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of them in my book.,BXS
ID,"They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over.",BXS
ID,"There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.",BXS
ID,"They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and call themselves by his name.",BXS
ID,"They are fearless and without religion, save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany tongue.",BXS
ID,"I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them posted.",BXS
ID,I have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship.,BXS
ID,"They took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could their spoken language.",BXS
ID,I have written the letters.,BXS
ID,"Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr. Hawkins to communicate with her.",BXS
ID,"To her I have explained my situation, but without the horrors which I may only surmise.",BXS
ID,It would shock and frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her.,BXS
ID,"Should the letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge.",BXS
ID,"I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted.",BXS
ID,"The man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them in his cap.",BXS
ID,I could do no more.,BXS
ID,"I stole back to the study, and began to read.",BXS
ID,"As the Count did not come in, I have written here.",BXS
ID,The Count has come.,BXS
ID,"He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters:--  ""The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they come, I shall, of course, take care.",BXS
ID,"See""!",BXS
ID,"--he must have looked at it--""one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other""--here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--""the other is a vile thin",BXS
ID,It is not signed.,BXS
ID,Well!,BXS
ID,"so it cannot matter to us"".",BXS
ID,And he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed.,BXS
ID,"Then he went on:--  ""The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is yours.",BXS
ID,Your letters are sacred to me.,BXS
ID,"Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal.",BXS
ID,"Will you not cover it again""?",BXS
ID,"He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope.",BXS
ID,I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.,BXS
ID,When he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly.,BXS
ID,"A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.",BXS
ID,"When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa.",BXS
ID,"He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said:--  ""So, my friend, you are tired?",BXS
ID,Get to bed.,BXS
ID,There is the surest rest.,BXS
ID,"I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours to me; but you will sleep, I pray"".",BXS
ID,"I passed to my room and went to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming.",BXS
ID,Despair has its own calms.,BXS
ID,"This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock!",BXS
ID,"Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle.",BXS
ID,"I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.",BXS
ID,"The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere.",BXS
ID,This looked like some new scheme of villainy.,BXS
ID,"This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.",BXS
ID,"With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots.",BXS
ID,They had also their long staves in hand.,BXS
ID,"I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.",BXS
ID,Again a shock: my door was fastened on the outside.,BXS
ID,Then I ran to the window and cried to them.,BXS
ID,"They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the ""hetman"" of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed.",BXS
ID,"Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me.",BXS
ID,They resolutely turned away.,BXS
ID,"The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved.",BXS
ID,"When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head.",BXS
ID,"Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.",BXS
ID,"Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room.",BXS
ID,"As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south.",BXS
ID,"I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.",BXS
ID,The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind.,BXS
ID,"I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.",BXS
ID,"I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count's window.",BXS
ID,"I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge.",BXS
ID,"It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away.",BXS
ID,"There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too!",BXS
ID,"This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me.",BXS
ID,"It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal's right and consolation.",BXS
ID,"I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window.",BXS
ID,Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.,BXS
ID,"They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way.",BXS
ID,"I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me.",BXS
ID,"I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aí‚rial gambolling.",BXS
ID,"Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.",BXS
ID,"Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight.",BXS
ID,"I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call.",BXS
ID,I was becoming hypnotised!,BXS
ID,Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond.,BXS
ID,More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes.,BXS
ID,"And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place.",BXS
ID,"The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed.",BXS
ID,"I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.",BXS
ID,"When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.",BXS
ID,"With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing.",BXS
ID,I sat down and simply cried.,BXS
ID,As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a woman.,BXS
ID,"I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between the bars.",BXS
ID,"There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running.",BXS
ID,She was leaning against a corner of the gateway.,BXS
ID,"When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--  ""Monster, give me my child""!",BXS
ID,"She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart.",BXS
ID,"Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion.",BXS
ID,"Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.",BXS
ID,"Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.",BXS
ID,His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.,BXS
ID,"Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.",BXS
ID,"There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short.",BXS
ID,"Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.",BXS
ID,"I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.",BXS
ID,What shall I do?,BXS
ID,what can I do?,BXS
ID,How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?,BXS
ID,No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.,BXS
ID,"When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.",BXS
ID,My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.,BXS
ID,I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me.,BXS
ID,"Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.",BXS
ID,Let me not think of it.,BXS
ID,Action!,BXS
ID,"It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.",BXS
ID,I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight.,BXS
ID,"Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep?",BXS
ID,If I could only get into his room!,BXS
ID,But there is no possible way.,BXS
ID,"The door is always locked, no way for me.",BXS
ID,"Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.",BXS
ID,Where his body has gone why may not another body go?,BXS
ID,I have seen him myself crawl from his window.,BXS
ID,"Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?",BXS
ID,"The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.",BXS
ID,I shall risk it.,BXS
ID,"At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.",BXS
ID,God help me in my task!,BXS
ID,"Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!",BXS
ID,"I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room.",BXS
ID,I must put down every detail in order.,BXS
ID,"I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side.",BXS
ID,"The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them.",BXS
ID,"I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.",BXS
ID,"I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it.",BXS
ID,"I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available.",BXS
ID,I did not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash.,BXS
ID,"I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window.",BXS
ID,"Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.",BXS
ID,The room was empty!,BXS
ID,"It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust.",BXS
ID,"I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere.",BXS
ID,"The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.",BXS
ID,None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old.,BXS
ID,"There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.",BXS
ID,At one corner of the room was a heavy door.,BXS
ID,"I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain.",BXS
ID,"It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down.",BXS
ID,"I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry.",BXS
ID,"At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned.",BXS
ID,As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier.,BXS
ID,"At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard.",BXS
ID,"The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks.",BXS
ID,"There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none.",BXS
ID,"Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.",BXS
ID,"I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul.",BXS
ID,"Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.",BXS
ID,"There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!",BXS
ID,"He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as ever.",BXS
ID,"But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.",BXS
ID,"I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.",BXS
ID,"He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.",BXS
ID,"By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.",BXS
ID,"I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall.",BXS
ID,"Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think.",BXS
ID,"To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes.",BXS
ID,"As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would have any effect on him.",BXS
ID,"I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters.",BXS
ID,"I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.",BXS
ID,"I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:--  ""To-morrow, my friend, we must part.",BXS
ID,"You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet.",BXS
ID,"Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey.",BXS
ID,"In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks.",BXS
ID,"When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz.",BXS
ID,"But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula"".",BXS
ID,"I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.",BXS
ID,Sincerity!,BXS
ID,"It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--  ""Why may I not go to-night""?",BXS
ID,"""Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission"".",BXS
ID,"""But I would walk with pleasure.",BXS
ID,"I want to get away at once"".",BXS
ID,"He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness.",BXS
ID,"He said:--  ""And your baggage""?",BXS
ID,"""I do not care about it.",BXS
ID,"I can send for it some other time"".",BXS
ID,"The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:--  ""You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.",BXS
ID,"' Come with me, my dear young friend.",BXS
ID,"Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it.",BXS
ID,"Come""!",BXS
ID,"With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall.",BXS
ID,Suddenly he stopped.,BXS
ID,"""Hark""!",BXS
ID,Close at hand came the howling of many wolves.,BXS
ID,"It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bí¢ton of the conductor.",BXS
ID,"After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.",BXS
ID,To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.,BXS
ID,"Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.",BXS
ID,"As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.",BXS
ID,I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.,BXS
ID,"With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing.",BXS
ID,"But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.",BXS
ID,"There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:--  ""Shut the door; I shall wait till morning""!",BXS
ID,and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.,BXS
ID,"With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.",BXS
ID,"In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room.",BXS
ID,"The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of.",BXS
ID,"When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door.",BXS
ID,I went to it softly and listened.,BXS
ID,"Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--  ""Back, back, to your own place!",BXS
ID,Your time is not yet come.,BXS
ID,Wait!,BXS
ID,Have patience!,BXS
ID,To-night is mine.,BXS
ID,"To-morrow night is yours""!",BXS
ID,"There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips.",BXS
ID,"As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",BXS
ID,I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.,BXS
ID,It is then so near the end?,BXS
ID,To-morrow!,BXS
ID,to-morrow!,BXS
ID,"Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear!",BXS
ID,These may be the last words I ever write in this diary.,BXS
ID,"I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready.",BXS
ID,"At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come.",BXS
ID,"Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.",BXS
ID,"With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall.",BXS
ID,"I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me.",BXS
ID,"With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts.",BXS
ID,But the door would not move.,BXS
ID,Despair seized me.,BXS
ID,"I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement.",BXS
ID,I could see the bolt shot.,BXS
ID,It had been locked after I left the Count.,BXS
ID,"Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's room.",BXS
ID,"He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils.",BXS
ID,"Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Count's room.",BXS
ID,"It was empty, but that was as I expected.",BXS
ID,"I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained.",BXS
ID,I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.,BXS
ID,I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.,BXS
ID,"The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home.",BXS
ID,"I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror.",BXS
ID,"There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck.",BXS
ID,"Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated.",BXS
ID,It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood.,BXS
ID,"He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion.",BXS
ID,"I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost.",BXS
ID,The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three.,BXS
ID,"I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key.",BXS
ID,Then I stopped and looked at the Count.,BXS
ID,There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad.,BXS
ID,"This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.",BXS
ID,The very thought drove me mad.,BXS
ID,A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster.,BXS
ID,"There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face.",BXS
ID,"But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror.",BXS
ID,"The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead.",BXS
ID,"The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight.",BXS
ID,"The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.",BXS
ID,"I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me.",BXS
ID,"As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming.",BXS
ID,"With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.",BXS
ID,"With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.",BXS
ID,"There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors.",BXS
ID,Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo.,BXS
ID,"I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying.",BXS
ID,"When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast.",BXS
ID,"I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.",BXS
ID,"As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth.",BXS
ID,There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down.,BXS
ID,"Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.",BXS
ID,"The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.",BXS
ID,Hark!,BXS
ID,"in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance.",BXS
ID,I am alone in the castle with those awful women.,BXS
ID,Faugh!,BXS
ID,"Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common.",BXS
ID,They are devils of the Pit!,BXS

ID,And then away for home!,BXS
ID,away to the quickest and nearest train!,BXS

ID,"He was very cool outwardly, but was nervous all the same.",BXS
ID,"He had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream.",BXS
ID,"He spoke to me, Mina, very straightforwardly.",BXS
ID,"He told me how dear I was to him, though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him.",BXS
ID,"He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble.",BXS
ID,"Then he broke off and asked if I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled, and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one else.",BXS
ID,"He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was free a man might have hope.",BXS
ID,"And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one.",BXS
ID,"I only told him that much, and then he stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever wanted a friend I must count him one of my best.",BXS
ID,"Oh, Mina dear, I can't help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted.",BXS
ID,"Being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing quite out of his life.",BXS
ID,"My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so miserable, though I am so happy.",BXS

ID,"I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man.",BXS
ID,"I suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him.",BXS
ID,I know now what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me.,BXS
ID,"No, I don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous.",BXS
ID,Mr. Quincey P. Morris found me alone.,BXS
ID,It seems that a man always does find a girl alone.,BXS
ID,"No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now.",BXS
ID,"I must tell you beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say, he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things.",BXS
ID,"I am afraid, my dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say.",BXS
ID,But this is a way slang has.,BXS
ID,"I do not know myself if I shall ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never heard him use any as yet.",BXS
ID,"Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was very nervous.",BXS
ID,"He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--  ""'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit.",BXS
ID,"Won't you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together, driving in double harness?",BXS
ID,"'  ""Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasn't broken to harness at all yet.",BXS
ID,"Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him.",BXS
ID,"He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day.",BXS
ID,"And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very heart and soul at my feet.",BXS
ID,"He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times.",BXS
ID,"I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--  ""'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know.",BXS
ID,"I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul.",BXS
ID,"Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for?",BXS
ID,"And if there is I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.",BXS
ID,"'  ""My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them?",BXS
ID,"Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman.",BXS
ID,"I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very badly.",BXS
ID,"Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble?",BXS
ID,"But this is heresy, and I must not say it.",BXS
ID,"I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--  ""'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.",BXS
ID,"' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--  ""'That's my brave girl.",BXS
ID,It's better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world.,BXS
ID,"Don't cry, my dear.",BXS
ID,"If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it standing up.",BXS
ID,"If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me.",BXS
ID,"Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a lover; it's more unselfish anyhow.",BXS
ID,"My dear, I'm going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come.",BXS
ID,Won't you give me one kiss?,BXS
ID,It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then.,BXS
ID,"You can, you know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken yet.",BXS
ID,"' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?",BXS
ID,--and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him.,BXS
ID,"He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--  ""'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these things don't make us friends nothing ever will.",BXS
ID,"Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.",BXS
ID,"' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby.",BXS
ID,"Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on?",BXS
ID,I know I would if I were free--only I don't want to be free.,BXS
ID,"My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.",BXS
ID,"""P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn't tell you of number Three, need I?",BXS
ID,"Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing me.",BXS
ID,"I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to deserve it.",BXS
ID,"I must only try in the future to show that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a friend.",BXS
ID,Ebb tide in appetite to-day.,BXS
ID,"Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary instead.",BXS
ID,Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.,BXS
ID,"As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went down amongst the patients.",BXS
ID,I picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest.,BXS
ID,He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well as I can.,BXS
ID,To-day I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.,BXS
ID,"I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination.",BXS
ID,"In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.",BXS
ID,I seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell.,BXS
ID,"_ If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards _accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--  R. M. Renfield, í_tat 59.",BXS

ID,In selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves.,BXS
ID,"What I think of on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc.",BXS

ID,This is a lovely place.,BXS
ID,"The little river, the Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour.",BXS
ID,"A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is.",BXS
ID,"The valley is beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to see down.",BXS
ID,"The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg.",BXS
ID,"Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of ""Marmion,"" where the girl was built up in the wall.",BXS
ID,"It is a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows.",BXS
ID,"Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big graveyard, all full of tombstones.",BXS
ID,"This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea.",BXS
ID,"It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed.",BXS
ID,In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below.,BXS
ID,"There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze.",BXS
ID,I shall come and sit here very often myself and work.,BXS
ID,"Indeed, I am writing now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me.",BXS
ID,They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk.,BXS
ID,"The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse.",BXS
ID,A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it.,BXS
ID,"On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a lighthouse.",BXS
ID,"Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.",BXS
ID,"It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there.",BXS
ID,"Outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse.",BXS
ID,"At the end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind.",BXS
ID,They have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea.,BXS
ID,I must ask the old man about this; he is coming this way.,BXS
ID,He is a funny old man.,BXS
ID,"He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.",BXS
ID,"He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was fought.",BXS
ID,"He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady at the abbey he said very brusquely:--  ""I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss.",BXS

ID,"He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps.",BXS
ID,The steps are a great feature on the place.,BXS
ID,"They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them.",BXS
ID,I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey.,BXS
ID,I shall go home too.,BXS
ID,"Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go.",BXS

ID,"He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody.",BXS
ID,"If he can't out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views.",BXS

ID,"Of course, I said that would do.",BXS
ID,I must watch him.,BXS
ID,"He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several very big fellows in a box.",BXS
ID,"He keeps feeding them with his flies, and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room.",BXS
ID,"His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them.",BXS
ID,"He looked very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all events.",BXS
ID,"He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time as before for reduction.",BXS
ID,"He disgusted me much while with him, for when a horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room, he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his mouth and ate it.",BXS
ID,"I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and gave life to him.",BXS
ID,"This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one.",BXS
ID,I must watch how he gets rid of his spiders.,BXS
ID,"He has evidently some deep problem in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always jotting down something.",BXS
ID,"Whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the totals added in batches again, as though he were ""focussing"" some account, as the auditors put it.",BXS
ID,"There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing.",BXS
ID,"It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh, unconscious cerebration!",BXS
ID,you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother.,BXS
ID,"I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I might notice if there were any change.",BXS
ID,Things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one.,BXS
ID,"He has managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it.",BXS
ID,"His means of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished.",BXS
ID,"Those that do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food.",BXS
ID,We are progressing.,BXS
ID,"My friend has now a whole colony of sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated.",BXS
ID,"When I came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very, very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog.",BXS
ID,"I asked him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing:--  ""A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with, and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed""!",BXS
ID,"I was not unprepared for this request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten.",BXS
ID,"His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--  ""Oh, yes, I would like a cat!",BXS
ID,I only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat.,BXS
ID,"No one would refuse me a kitten, would they""?",BXS
ID,"I shook my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but that I would see about it.",BXS
ID,"His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing.",BXS
ID,The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac.,BXS
ID,I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know more.,BXS
ID,I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding.,BXS
ID,When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.,BXS
ID,"I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner where I had found him.",BXS
ID,I shall see him in the morning early.,BXS
ID,"Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his rounds.",BXS
ID,Found him up and humming a tune.,BXS
ID,"He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace.",BXS
ID,"I looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they were.",BXS
ID,"He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.",BXS
ID,There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood.,BXS
ID,"I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day.",BXS
ID,The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers.,BXS
ID,"""My belief is, doctor,"" he said, ""that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw""!",BXS
ID,"I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it.",BXS
ID,"The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory proved.",BXS
ID,My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind.,BXS
ID,"I shall have to invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoí_phagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way.",BXS
ID,"He gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds.",BXS
ID,What would have been his later steps?,BXS
ID,It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment.,BXS
ID,It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause.,BXS
ID,"Men sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day!",BXS
ID,Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain?,BXS
ID,Had I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's brain-knowledge would be as nothing.,BXS
ID,If only there were a sufficient cause!,BXS
ID,"I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?",BXS
ID,How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope.,BXS
ID,"I wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one.",BXS
ID,"He has closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record.",BXS
ID,How many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?,BXS
ID,"To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record.",BXS
ID,So it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss.,BXS
ID,"Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on hopeless and work.",BXS
ID,Work!,BXS
ID,work!,BXS
ID,"If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.",BXS
ID,"I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time.",BXS
ID,And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing.,BXS
ID,I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan.,BXS
ID,"I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him.",BXS
ID,"I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received.",BXS
ID,"It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula, and says that he is just starting for home.",BXS
ID,"That is not like Jonathan; I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy.",BXS
ID,"Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep.",BXS
ID,"Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our room every night.",BXS
ID,Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place.,BXS
ID,"Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped.",BXS
ID,"Lucy is to be married in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged.",BXS
ID,"I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make both ends meet.",BXS
ID,Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon.,BXS
ID,"Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is counting the moments till he comes.",BXS
ID,She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby.,BXS
ID,I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he arrives.,BXS
ID,No news from Jonathan.,BXS
ID,"I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line.",BXS
ID,"Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I am awakened by her moving about the room.",BXS
ID,"Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself.",BXS
ID,"Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.",BXS
ID,"Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink.",BXS
ID,She has lost that aní_mic look which she had.,BXS
ID,I pray it will all last.,BXS
ID,"Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard.",BXS
ID,"Oh, I do hope he is not ill.",BXS
ID,He surely would have written.,BXS
ID,"I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it does not satisfy me.",BXS
ID,"It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing.",BXS
ID,There is no mistake of that.,BXS
ID,"Lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me.",BXS
ID,"She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room searching for the key.",BXS
ID,"Another three days, and no news.",BXS
ID,This suspense is getting dreadful.,BXS
ID,"If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter.",BXS
ID,I must only pray to God for patience.,BXS
ID,"Lucy is more excitable than ever, but is otherwise well.",BXS
ID,"Last night was very threatening, and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm.",BXS
ID,I must try to watch it and learn the weather signs.,BXS
ID,"To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness.",BXS
ID,"Everything is grey--except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock; grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers.",BXS
ID,"The sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar, muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland.",BXS
ID,The horizon is lost in a grey mist.,BXS
ID,"All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and there is a ""brool"" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.",BXS
ID,"Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in the mist, and seem ""men like trees walking"".",BXS
ID,"The fishing-boats are racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour, bending to the scuppers.",BXS
ID,Here comes old Mr. Swales.,BXS
ID,"He is making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that he wants to talk.",BXS
ID,I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man.,BXS
ID,"When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--  ""I want to say something to you, miss"".",BXS
ID,"I could see he was not at ease, so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--  ""I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past; but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone.",BXS
ID,"We aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it; an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my own heart a bit.",BXS
ID,"But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it.",BXS
ID,"My time must be nigh at hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his scythe.",BXS
ID,"Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at once; the chafts will wag as they be used to.",BXS
ID,Some day soon the Angel of Death will sound his trumpet for me.,BXS
ID,"But don't ye dooal an' greet, my deary""!",BXS
ID,"--for he saw that I was crying--""if he should come this very night I'd not refuse to answer his call.",BXS
ID,"For life be, after all, only a waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that we can rightly depend on.",BXS
ID,"But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my deary, and comin' quick.",BXS
ID,It may be comin' while we be lookin' and wonderin'.,BXS
ID,"Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts.",BXS
ID,Look!,BXS
ID,"look""!",BXS
ID,he cried suddenly.,BXS
ID,"""There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death.",BXS
ID,It's in the air; I feel it comin'.,BXS
ID,"Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call comes""!",BXS
ID,"He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat.",BXS
ID,His mouth moved as though he were praying.,BXS
ID,"After a few minutes' silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled off.",BXS
ID,"It all touched me, and upset me very much.",BXS
ID,"I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his arm.",BXS
ID,"He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship.",BXS
ID,"""I can't make her out,"" he said; ""she's a Russian, by the look of her; but she's knocking about in the queerest way.",BXS
ID,"She doesn't know her mind a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to run up north in the open, or to put in here.",BXS
ID,Look there again!,BXS
ID,"She is steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel; changes about with every puff of wind.",BXS
ID,"We'll hear more of her before this time to-morrow"".",BXS
ID,"One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique.",BXS
ID,"The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August.",BXS
ID,"Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby.",BXS
ID,"The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of ""tripping"" both to and from Whitby.",BXS
ID,"The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of ""mares'-tails"" high in the sky to the north-west.",BXS
ID,"The wind was then blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked ""No.",BXS
ID,"2: light breeze"".",BXS
ID,"The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm.",BXS
ID,"The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty.",BXS
ID,"Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes.",BXS
ID,"The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the ""Prelude to the Great Storm"" will grace the R. A. and R. I. walls in May next.",BXS
ID,"More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his ""cobble"" or his ""mule,"" as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.",BXS
ID,"The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature.",BXS
ID,"There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually ""hug"" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishing-boats were in sight.",BXS
ID,"The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards.",BXS
ID,"The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger.",BXS
ID,"Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,      ""As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean"".",BXS
ID,"Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of nature's silence.",BXS
ID,"A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.",BXS
ID,Then without warning the tempest broke.,BXS
ID,"With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.",BXS
ID,"The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.",BXS
ID,"White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour.",BXS
ID,"The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions.",BXS
ID,"It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold.",BXS
ID,"To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.",BXS
ID,"At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm.",BXS
ID,"Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird.",BXS
ID,"On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.",BXS
ID,"The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.",BXS
ID,"Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.",BXS
ID,"As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.",BXS
ID,"Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening.",BXS
ID,"The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was.",BXS
ID,"Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour.",BXS
ID,"It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, ""she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell"".",BXS
ID,"Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before.",BXS
ID,"The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless.",BXS
ID,"The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour.",BXS
ID,"The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship.",BXS
ID,No other form could be seen on deck at all.,BXS
ID,"A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man!",BXS
ID,"However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words.",BXS
ID,"The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.",BXS
ID,There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap.,BXS
ID,"Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the ""top-hammer"" came crashing down.",BXS
ID,"But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand.",BXS
ID,"Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones--""thruff-steans"" or ""through-stones,"" as they call them in the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.",BXS
ID,"It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above.",BXS
ID,"Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board.",BXS
ID,"The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there.",BXS
ID,"The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion.",BXS
ID,"This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run.",BXS
ID,"It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.",BXS
ID,"When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board.",BXS
ID,"By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.",BXS
ID,"It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen.",BXS
ID,"The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel.",BXS
ID,"Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords.",BXS
ID,"The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone.",BXS
ID,"Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days.",BXS
ID,"In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log.",BXS
ID,"The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth.",BXS
ID,"The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict.",BXS
ID,"Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_.",BXS
ID,It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.,BXS
ID,"Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds.",BXS
ID,"I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.",BXS
ID,The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.,BXS
ID,"It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the _Demeter_.",BXS
ID,"She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.",BXS
ID,"This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him.",BXS
ID,"The Russian consul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc.",BXS
ID,Nothing is talked about here to-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations.,BXS
ID,"As the matter is to be a ""nine days' wonder,"" they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint.",BXS
ID,"A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal.",BXS
ID,"To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.",BXS
ID,"It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror.",BXS
ID,"There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute.",BXS
ID,"Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard.",BXS
ID,"It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.",BXS
ID,"By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men.",BXS
ID,"The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across.",BXS
ID,"As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo.",BXS
ID,"It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage.",BXS
ID,"Of course my statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short.",BXS
ID,"_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land.",BXS
ID,"_   On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.",BXS
ID,At noon set sail.,BXS
ID,"East wind, fresh.",BXS
ID,"Crew, five hands .",BXS
ID,"two mates, cook, and myself (captain).",BXS
ID,On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus.,BXS
ID,Boarded by Turkish Customs officers.,BXS
ID,Backsheesh.,BXS
ID,All correct.,BXS
ID,On 12 July through Dardanelles.,BXS

ID,"Work of officers thorough, but quick.",BXS
ID,Want us off soon.,BXS
ID,At dark passed into Archipelago.,BXS
ID,On 13 July passed Cape Matapan.,BXS
ID,Crew dissatisfied about something.,BXS
ID,"Seemed scared, but would not speak out.",BXS
ID,On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew.,BXS
ID,"Men all steady fellows, who sailed with me before.",BXS
ID,"Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves.",BXS
ID,Mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him.,BXS
ID,"Expected fierce quarrel, but all was quiet.",BXS
ID,"On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was missing.",BXS
ID,Could not account for it.,BXS
ID,"Took larboard watch eight bells last night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk.",BXS
ID,Men more downcast than ever.,BXS
ID,"All said they expected something of the kind, but would not say more than there was _something_ aboard.",BXS
ID,Mate getting very impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.,BXS
ID,"On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship.",BXS
ID,"He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way, and go along the deck forward, and disappear.",BXS
ID,"He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.",BXS
ID,"He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread.",BXS
ID,"To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern.",BXS
ID,"Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from stem to stern.",BXS
ID,"First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike.",BXS
ID,"I let him take the helm, while the rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left no corner unsearched.",BXS
ID,"As there were only the big wooden boxes, there were no odd corners where a man could hide.",BXS
ID,"Men much relieved when search over, and went back to work cheerfully.",BXS
ID,"First mate scowled, but said nothing.",BXS
ID,"Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with sails--no time to be frightened.",BXS
ID,Men seem to have forgotten their dread.,BXS
ID,"Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms.",BXS
ID,Praised men for work in bad weather.,BXS
ID,Passed Gibralter and out through Straits.,BXS
ID,All well.,BXS
ID,There seems some doom over this ship.,BXS
ID,"Already a hand short, and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last night another man lost--disappeared.",BXS
ID,"Like the first, he came off his watch and was not seen again.",BXS
ID,"Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone.",BXS
ID,Mate angry.,BXS
ID,"Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do some violence.",BXS
ID,"Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom, and the wind a tempest.",BXS
ID,No sleep for any one.,BXS
ID,Men all worn out.,BXS
ID,"Hardly know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on.",BXS
ID,"Second mate volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep.",BXS
ID,"Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is steadier.",BXS
ID,Another tragedy.,BXS
ID,"Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double.",BXS
ID,When morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman.,BXS
ID,"Raised outcry, and all came on deck.",BXS
ID,"Thorough search, but no one found.",BXS
ID,"Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic.",BXS
ID,Mate and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.,BXS
ID,Last night.,BXS
ID,Rejoiced we are nearing England.,BXS
ID,"Weather fine, all sails set.",BXS
ID,Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing.,BXS
ID,Only self and mate and two hands left to work ship.,BXS
ID,"Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted.",BXS
ID,Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.,BXS
ID,"Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind.",BXS
ID,"Dare not lower, as could not raise them again.",BXS
ID,We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom.,BXS
ID,Mate now more demoralised than either of men.,BXS
ID,His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself.,BXS
ID,"Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst.",BXS
ID,"They are Russian, he Roumanian.",BXS
ID,"Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port.",BXS
ID,Could see nothing in fog.,BXS
ID,"Rushed on deck, and ran against mate.",BXS
ID,"Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on watch.",BXS
ID,One more gone.,BXS
ID,"Lord, help us!",BXS
ID,"Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out.",BXS
ID,"If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.",BXS
ID,"At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there.",BXS
ID,"The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing.",BXS
ID,"I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate.",BXS
ID,After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels.,BXS
ID,"He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way.",BXS
ID,"He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: ""_It_ is here; I know it, now.",BXS
ID,"On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale.",BXS
ID,"It was in the bows, and looking out.",BXS
ID,"I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the air"".",BXS
ID,And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space.,BXS
ID,"Then he went on: ""But It is here, and I'll find It.",BXS
ID,"It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes.",BXS
ID,I'll unscrew them one by one and see.,BXS
ID,"You work the helm"".",BXS
ID,"And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip, he went below.",BXS
ID,"There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm.",BXS
ID,"I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway.",BXS
ID,"He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him.",BXS
ID,"He can't hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as ""clay,"" and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do.",BXS
ID,"So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes.",BXS
ID,I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.,BXS
ID,"Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails and lie by, and signal for help.",BXS
ID,It is nearly all over now.,BXS
ID,"Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear.",BXS
ID,"""Save me!",BXS
ID,"save me""!",BXS
ID,"he cried, and then looked round on the blanket of fog.",BXS
ID,"His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: ""You had better come too, captain, before it is too late.",BXS
ID,_He_ is there.,BXS
ID,I know the secret now.,BXS
ID,"The sea will save me from Him, and it is all that is left""!",BXS
ID,"Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea.",BXS
ID,"I suppose I know the secret too, now.",BXS
ID,"It was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself.",BXS
ID,God help me!,BXS
ID,How am I to account for all these horrors when I get to port?,BXS
ID,_When_ I get to port!,BXS
ID,Will that ever be?,BXS
ID,"Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce.",BXS
ID,"I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not.",BXS
ID,"I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the dimness of the night I saw It--Him!",BXS
ID,"God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard.",BXS
ID,It was better to die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object.,BXS
ID,"But I am captain, and I must not leave my ship.",BXS
ID,"But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He--It!",BXS
ID,"--dare not touch; and then, come good wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain.",BXS
ID,"I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on.",BXS
ID,"If He can look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.",BXS
ID,"If we are wrecked, mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not, .",BXS
ID,"well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust.",BXS
ID,God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty.,BXS
ID,Of course the verdict was an open one.,BXS
ID,There is no evidence to adduce; and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say.,BXS
ID,"The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral.",BXS
ID,Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff.,BXS
ID,The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave.,BXS
ID,"No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town.",BXS
ID,"To-morrow will see the funeral; and so will end this one more ""mystery of the sea"".",BXS
ID,"Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep.",BXS
ID,"The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, it made me shudder.",BXS
ID,When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun.,BXS
ID,"Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself.",BXS
ID,"Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed.",BXS
ID,"It is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life.",BXS
ID,Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.,BXS
ID,"There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd.",BXS
ID,"Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land.",BXS
ID,"But, oh, is he on land or sea?",BXS
ID,"Where is he, and how?",BXS
ID,I am getting fearfully anxious about him.,BXS
ID,"If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!",BXS
ID,The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching.,BXS
ID,"Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.",BXS
ID,"Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortíÂge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again.",BXS
ID,"We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.",BXS
ID,The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything.,BXS
ID,Poor Lucy seemed much upset.,BXS
ID,"She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her.",BXS
ID,"She is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she does not understand it herself.",BXS
ID,"There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken.",BXS
ID,"He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder.",BXS
ID,Poor dear old man!,BXS
ID,Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes!,BXS
ID,Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do.,BXS
ID,"Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals.",BXS
ID,One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.,BXS
ID,The dog is always with him.,BXS
ID,"They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark.",BXS
ID,"During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling.",BXS
ID,"Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise.",BXS
ID,"It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path.",BXS
ID,"Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed.",BXS
ID,The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble.,BXS
ID,"It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it.",BXS
ID,"Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way.",BXS
ID,I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble.,BXS
ID,"She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure.",BXS
ID,"The whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all afford material for her dreams.",BXS
ID,"I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and back.",BXS
ID,She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.,BXS
ID,"Oh, but I am tired!",BXS
ID,If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night.,BXS
ID,We had a lovely walk.,BXS
ID,"Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us.",BXS
ID,"I believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start.",BXS
ID,"We had a capital ""severe tea"" at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand.",BXS
ID,"I believe we should have shocked the ""New Woman"" with our appetites.",BXS
ID,"Men are more tolerant, bless them!",BXS
ID,"Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls.",BXS
ID,"Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.",BXS
ID,"The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper.",BXS
ID,"Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic.",BXS
ID,"I think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired.",BXS
ID,Lucy is asleep and breathing softly.,BXS
ID,"She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet.",BXS
ID,"If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.",BXS
ID,"Some of the ""New Women"" writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting.",BXS
ID,But I suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself.,BXS
ID,"And a nice job she will make of it, too!",BXS
ID,There's some consolation in that.,BXS
ID,"I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy seems better.",BXS
ID,"I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming.",BXS
ID,I should be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.,BXS
ID,God bless and keep him.,BXS
ID,Diary again.,BXS
ID,"No sleep now, so I may as well write.",BXS
ID,I am too agitated to sleep.,BXS
ID,"We have had such an adventure, such an agonising experience.",BXS
ID,I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary.,BXS
ID,"Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me.",BXS
ID,"The room was dark, so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her.",BXS
ID,The bed was empty.,BXS
ID,I lit a match and found that she was not in the room.,BXS
ID,"The door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it.",BXS
ID,"I feared to wake her mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her.",BXS
ID,As I was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention.,BXS
ID,"Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.",BXS
ID,Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places.,BXS
ID,"""Thank God,"" I said to myself, ""she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress"".",BXS
ID,I ran downstairs and looked in the sitting-room.,BXS
ID,Not there!,BXS
ID,"Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart.",BXS
ID,Finally I came to the hall door and found it open.,BXS
ID,"It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught.",BXS
ID,"The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was.",BXS
ID,"There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details.",BXS
ID,"I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.",BXS
ID,"The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight.",BXS
ID,"I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected.",BXS
ID,"At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy in our favourite seat.",BXS
ID,"There was a bright full moon, with heavy black, driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across.",BXS
ID,"For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all around it.",BXS
ID,"Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually visible.",BXS
ID,"Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a half-reclining figure, snowy white.",BXS
ID,"The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it.",BXS
ID,"What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff.",BXS
ID,"The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition.",BXS
ID,"The time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey.",BXS
ID,"I must have gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty.",BXS
ID,"When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow.",BXS
ID,"There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure.",BXS
ID,"I called in fright, ""Lucy!",BXS
ID,"Lucy""!",BXS
ID,"and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes.",BXS
ID,"Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the entrance of the churchyard.",BXS
ID,"As I entered, the church was between me and the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her.",BXS
ID,"When I came in view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat.",BXS
ID,"She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living thing about.",BXS
ID,When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.,BXS
ID,"Her lips were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath.",BXS
ID,"As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat.",BXS
ID,"Whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold.",BXS
ID,"I flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck, for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air, unclad as she was.",BXS
ID,"I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned.",BXS
ID,When I had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her.,BXS
ID,"At first she did not respond; but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing occasionally.",BXS
ID,"At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly, till finally she opened her eyes and awoke.",BXS
ID,"She did not seem surprised to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.",BXS
ID,"Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.",BXS
ID,"She trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.",BXS
ID,"As we passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.",BXS
ID,She stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.,BXS
ID,"However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.",BXS
ID,"Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.",BXS
ID,"Once we saw a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here, steep little closes, or ""wynds,"" as they call them in Scotland.",BXS
ID,My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I should faint.,BXS
ID,"I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation in case the story should get wind.",BXS
ID,"When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed.",BXS
ID,"Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.",BXS
ID,"I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay, infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so.",BXS
ID,I hope I did right.,BXS
ID,"I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.",BXS
ID,Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea.,BXS
ID,All goes well.,BXS
ID,Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side.,BXS
ID,"The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks.",BXS
ID,I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.,BXS
ID,"Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.",BXS
ID,"I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood.",BXS
ID,"When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.",BXS
ID,"Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.",BXS
ID,We passed a happy day.,BXS
ID,"The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze.",BXS
ID,"We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliff-path and joining her at the gate.",BXS
ID,"I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me.",BXS
ID,But there!,BXS
ID,I must only be patient.,BXS
ID,"In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early.",BXS
ID,"Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.",BXS
ID,"I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.",BXS
ID,"My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out.",BXS
ID,"She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest.",BXS
ID,"I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window.",BXS
ID,"Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning.",BXS
ID,"All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur.",BXS
ID,"I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.",BXS
ID,"Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable.",BXS
ID,"Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before.",BXS
ID,"Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window.",BXS
ID,"I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out.",BXS
ID,"It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great, silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words.",BXS
ID,"Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles.",BXS
ID,"Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey.",BXS
ID,"When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.",BXS
ID,She did not stir again all night.,BXS
ID,"On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.",BXS
ID,"Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner.",BXS
ID,This afternoon she made a funny remark.,BXS
ID,"We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do.",BXS
ID,"The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow.",BXS
ID,"We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--  ""His red eyes again!",BXS
ID,"They are just the same"".",BXS
ID,"It was such an odd expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me.",BXS
ID,"I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but followed her eyes.",BXS
ID,"She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone.",BXS
ID,"I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion.",BXS
ID,"The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved.",BXS
ID,"I called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there.",BXS
ID,"We never refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner.",BXS
ID,Lucy had a headache and went early to bed.,BXS
ID,"I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan.",BXS
ID,"When coming home--it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out.",BXS
ID,"I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it.",BXS
ID,She did not notice or make any movement whatever.,BXS
ID,"Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window.",BXS
ID,There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut.,BXS
ID,"She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird.",BXS
ID,"I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.",BXS
ID,"I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened.",BXS
ID,"She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.",BXS
ID,I fear she is fretting about something.,BXS
ID,I wish I could find out what it is.,BXS
ID,Rose later than usual.,BXS
ID,"Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called.",BXS
ID,We had a happy surprise at breakfast.,BXS
ID,"Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.",BXS
ID,"Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.",BXS
ID,Later on in the day she told me the cause.,BXS
ID,"She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her.",BXS
ID,"Poor dear, sweet lady!",BXS
ID,She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant.,BXS
ID,"She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening.",BXS
ID,"At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her.",BXS
ID,"Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.",BXS
ID,No diary for two whole days.,BXS
ID,I have not had the heart to write.,BXS
ID,Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.,BXS
ID,"No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her mother's hours are numbering to a close.",BXS
ID,I do not understand Lucy's fading away as she is doing.,BXS
ID,"She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping as if for air.",BXS
ID,"I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window.",BXS
ID,"Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint.",BXS
ID,"When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath.",BXS
ID,When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away.,BXS
ID,I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin.,BXS
ID,"I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.",BXS
ID,"They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white.",BXS
ID,They are like little white dots with red centres.,BXS
ID,"Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.",BXS
ID,"""Herewith please receive invoice of goods sent by Great Northern Railway.",BXS

ID,"I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard.",BXS
ID,Lucy is ever so much better.,BXS
ID,"Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once.",BXS
ID,"The roses seem coming back already to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking.",BXS
ID,"If she were in any way aní_mic I could understand it, but she is not.",BXS
ID,She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness.,BXS
ID,"All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this very seat, I found her asleep.",BXS
ID,"As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--  ""My poor little feet didn't make much noise then!",BXS
ID,"I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up Geordie"".",BXS
ID,"As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed at all that night.",BXS
ID,"Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does.",BXS
ID,"Then she went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:--  ""I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real.",BXS
ID,"I only wanted to be here in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I don't know what.",BXS
ID,"I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing through the streets and over the bridge.",BXS
ID,"A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as I went up the steps.",BXS
ID,"Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.",BXS
ID,"I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body.",BXS
ID,"I saw you do it before I felt you"".",BXS
ID,Then she began to laugh.,BXS
ID,"It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly.",BXS
ID,"I did not quite like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again.",BXS
ID,"When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more rosy.",BXS
ID,"Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.",BXS
ID,"Joy, joy, joy!",BXS
ID,although not all joy.,BXS
ID,"At last, news of Jonathan.",BXS
ID,The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write.,BXS
ID,"I am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Hawkins sent me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly.",BXS
ID,"I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home.",BXS

ID,Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night.,BXS
ID,About eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting.,BXS
ID,"The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest in him, encouraged him to talk.",BXS
ID,"He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty.",BXS
ID,Would not condescend to talk with him at all.,BXS
ID,"All he would say was:--       ""I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at      hand"".",BXS
ID,The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him.,BXS
ID,"If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous.",BXS
ID,The combination is a dreadful one.,BXS
ID,At nine o'clock I visited him myself.,BXS
ID,His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing.,BXS
ID,"It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God.",BXS
ID,These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being.,BXS
ID,How these madmen give themselves away!,BXS
ID,The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow.,BXS
ID,"Oh, if men only knew!",BXS
ID,For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree.,BXS
ID,"I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same.",BXS
ID,"All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well.",BXS
ID,"He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes.",BXS
ID,"I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention.",BXS
ID,"At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--  ""Bother them all!",BXS
ID,"I don't care a pin about them"".",BXS
ID,"""What""?",BXS

ID,"""You don't mean to tell me you don't care about spiders""?",BXS

ID,I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about.,BXS
ID,Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers.,BXS
ID,The attendant was waiting for me.,BXS
ID,"He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door.",BXS
ID,His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.,BXS
ID,"He ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me.",BXS
ID,"He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.",BXS
ID,"The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door.",BXS
ID,"He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through the window.",BXS
ID,"I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt.",BXS
ID,"The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.",BXS
ID,As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.,BXS
ID,"I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous.",BXS
ID,"I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the other side.",BXS
ID,"I could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him.",BXS
ID,On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel.,BXS
ID,"He was talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might frighten him, and he should run off.",BXS
ID,"Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping is upon him!",BXS
ID,"After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.",BXS
ID,"I heard him say:--  ""I am here to do Your bidding, Master.",BXS
ID,"I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful.",BXS
ID,I have worshipped You long and afar off.,BXS
ID,"Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things""?",BXS
ID,He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow.,BXS
ID,He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a Real Presence.,BXS
ID,His manias make a startling combination.,BXS
ID,When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.,BXS
ID,"He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man.",BXS
ID,I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I shall not again.,BXS
ID,It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time.,BXS
ID,"With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before he was caged.",BXS
ID,He is safe now at any rate.,BXS
ID,"Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded room.",BXS
ID,"His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.",BXS
ID,"Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--  ""I shall be patient, Master.",BXS
ID,"It is coming--coming--coming""!",BXS
ID,"So I took the hint, and came too.",BXS
ID,"I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.",BXS
ID,"""I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby.",BXS
ID,"Well, my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here.",BXS
ID,"I feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.",BXS
ID,"I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking.",BXS
ID,"All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished.",BXS
ID,"He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past.",BXS
ID,"At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask.",BXS
ID,"He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it.",BXS
ID,"Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse, tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head.",BXS
ID,"I wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust.",BXS
ID,"She is a sweet, good soul, and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned.",BXS
ID,He has not forgotten you or what he owes to you.,BXS
ID,"His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.",BXS
ID,' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.,BXS
ID,The idea of _my_ being jealous about Jonathan!,BXS
ID,"And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a cause of trouble.",BXS
ID,"I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his face while he sleeps.",BXS
ID,He is waking!,BXS
ID,"""When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.",BXS
ID,"I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.",BXS
ID,"Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--  ""'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no secret, no concealment.",BXS
ID,"I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman.",BXS
ID,"You know I have had brain fever, and that is to be mad.",BXS
ID,"The secret is here, and I do not want to know it.",BXS
ID,"I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.",BXS
ID,"' For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete.",BXS
ID,"'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance?",BXS
ID,Here is the book.,BXS
ID,"Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.",BXS
ID,"' He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him.",BXS
ID,"I have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply.",BXS
ID,"""She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for.",BXS
ID,"We are to be married in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes.",BXS
ID,"""Lucy, the time has come and gone.",BXS
ID,"I feel very solemn, but very, very happy.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows.",BXS
ID,He answered his 'I will' firmly and strongly.,BXS
ID,I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me.,BXS
ID,The dear sisters were so kind.,BXS
ID,"Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon me.",BXS
ID,I must tell you of my wedding present.,BXS
ID,"When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring.",BXS
ID,"Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty.",BXS
ID,"Then he took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be.",BXS
ID,"The poor dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the year.",BXS
ID,"""Well, my dear, what could I say?",BXS
ID,"I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life.",BXS
ID,"And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us.",BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,"""Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",BXS
ID,"It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to me.",BXS
ID,It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life.,BXS
ID,"I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am.",BXS
ID,"My dear, please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust.",BXS

ID,"""Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband.",BXS
ID,I wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here.,BXS
ID,The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored me.,BXS
ID,"I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well.",BXS
ID,You will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep.,BXS
ID,"I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a week, that is when I once got into it at night.",BXS
ID,Arthur says I am getting fat.,BXS
ID,"By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here.",BXS
ID,"We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love him more than ever.",BXS
ID,"He _tells_ me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me more than he did then.",BXS

ID,The case of Renfield grows even more interesting.,BXS
ID,He has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.,BXS
ID,For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent.,BXS
ID,"Then one night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: ""Now I can wait; now I can wait"".",BXS
ID,"The attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him.",BXS
ID,"He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might almost say, ""cringing""--softness.",BXS
ID,"I was satisfied with his present condition, and directed him to be relieved.",BXS
ID,"The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest.",BXS
ID,"It was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:--  ""They think I could hurt you!",BXS
ID,Fancy _me_ hurting _you_!,BXS
ID,"The fools""!",BXS
ID,"It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought.",BXS
ID,"Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful to him?",BXS
ID,I must find out later on.,BXS
ID,To-night he will not speak.,BXS
ID,Even the offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him.,BXS
ID,"He will only say: ""I don't take any stock in cats.",BXS
ID,"I have more to think of now, and I can wait; I can wait"".",BXS
ID,After a while I left him.,BXS
ID,"The attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.",BXS

ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise.,BXS

ID,It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.,BXS
ID,Happy thought!,BXS
ID,We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones.,BXS

ID,"At any rate, we have proved one thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time.",BXS
ID,We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day.,BXS
ID,"I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise.",BXS
ID,The poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it.,BXS
ID,Hark!,BXS
ID,The unexpected again!,BXS
ID,I am called; the patient has once more escaped.,BXS
ID,Another night adventure.,BXS
ID,Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect.,BXS
ID,Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage.,BXS
ID,I sent word for the attendants to follow.,BXS
ID,"Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door.",BXS
ID,"When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill me.",BXS
ID,As we were holding him a strange thing happened.,BXS
ID,"He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew calm.",BXS
ID,"I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing.",BXS
ID,"Then I caught the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west.",BXS
ID,"Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own.",BXS
ID,"The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:--  ""You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly""!",BXS
ID,Without trouble we came back to the house.,BXS
ID,"I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night.",BXS
ID,"I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down.",BXS
ID,Then we can have long talks when we do meet.,BXS
ID,I wonder when it will be.,BXS
ID,"I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy.",BXS
ID,Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby.,BXS
ID,"Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again.",BXS
ID,"It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out.",BXS
ID,"When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful.",BXS
ID,I wonder if I could sleep in mother's room to-night.,BXS
ID,I shall make an excuse and try.,BXS
ID,Another bad night.,BXS
ID,Mother did not seem to take to my proposal.,BXS
ID,"She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me.",BXS
ID,"I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep.",BXS
ID,"There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have fallen asleep.",BXS
ID,More bad dreams.,BXS
ID,I wish I could remember them.,BXS
ID,This morning I am horribly weak.,BXS
ID,"My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me.",BXS

ID,"""I want you to do me a favour.",BXS
ID,"Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day.",BXS
ID,"I have asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal.",BXS
ID,Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet.,BXS
ID,I am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind.,BXS
ID,I am almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang.,BXS
ID,"I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented.",BXS
ID,"It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act.",BXS
ID,"You are to come to lunch at Hillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you.",BXS
ID,"I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her.",BXS
ID,Do not fail!,BXS
ID,"""With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that I know of.",BXS
ID,"At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last.",BXS
ID,Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over.,BXS
ID,"I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions.",BXS
ID,I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.,BXS
ID,"""I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits.",BXS
ID,"Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious.",BXS
ID,"I have no doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.",BXS
ID,"We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us.",BXS
ID,"Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me.",BXS
ID,"We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained, for the servants were coming and going.",BXS
ID,"As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.",BXS
ID,"When I saw that her high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis.",BXS
ID,"She said to me very sweetly:--  ""'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.",BXS
ID,"' I reminded her that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously anxious about her.",BXS
ID,"She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that matter in a word.",BXS
ID,'Tell Arthur everything you choose.,BXS
ID,"I do not care for myself, but all for him!",BXS
ID,' So I am quite free.,BXS
ID,"""I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see the usual aní_mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass.",BXS
ID,"It was a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them.",BXS
ID,"The qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in itself a vigorous state of health.",BXS
ID,"In other physical matters I was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental.",BXS
ID,"She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but regarding which she can remember nothing.",BXS
ID,"She says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back, and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned.",BXS
ID,"I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world.",BXS
ID,"I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to Miss Westenra.",BXS
ID,"This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for her.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his wishes.",BXS
ID,"He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else.",BXS
ID,"He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind.",BXS
ID,"This, with an iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution, self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.",BXS
ID,I tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in him.,BXS
ID,I have asked him to come at once.,BXS
ID,I shall see Miss Westenra to-morrow again.,BXS
ID,"She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.",BXS
ID,"""When I have received your letter I am already coming to you.",BXS
ID,"By good fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have trusted me.",BXS
ID,"Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear.",BXS
ID,"Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do.",BXS
ID,"But it is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.",BXS
ID,"Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that night.",BXS
ID,"But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer if it must.",BXS
ID,"Till then good-bye, my friend John.",BXS
ID,"""Van Helsing has come and gone.",BXS
ID,"He came on with me to Hillingham, and found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that we were alone with her.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing made a very careful examination of the patient.,BXS
ID,"He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of course I was not present all the time.",BXS
ID,"He is, I fear, much concerned, but says he must think.",BXS
ID,"When I told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.",BXS
ID,"Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will.",BXS
ID,"Nay, I am not jesting.",BXS
ID,"This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.",BXS
ID,"' I asked what he meant by that, for he was very serious.",BXS
ID,"This was when we had come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to Amsterdam.",BXS
ID,He would not give me any further clue.,BXS
ID,"You must not be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good.",BXS
ID,"He will speak plainly enough when the time comes, be sure.",BXS
ID,"So I told him I would simply write an account of our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for _The Daily Telegraph_.",BXS
ID,"He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here.",BXS
ID,I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make it.,BXS
ID,In any case I am to have a letter.,BXS
ID,"""Well, as to the visit.",BXS
ID,"Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first saw her, and certainly looked better.",BXS
ID,"She had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal.",BXS
ID,"She was very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it.",BXS
ID,"I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick look under his bushy brows that I knew of old.",BXS
ID,Then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into reality.,BXS
ID,"Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--  ""'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved.",BXS
ID,"That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not see.",BXS
ID,"They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale.",BXS
ID,"To them I say: ""Pouf""!",BXS
ID,' And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are.,BXS
ID,"How can he'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything of a young ladies?",BXS
ID,"He has his madams to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and to those that love them.",BXS
ID,"It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness.",BXS
ID,But the young ladies!,BXS
ID,"He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them.",BXS
ID,"So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.",BXS
ID,"' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the professor came to the window and called me in.",BXS
ID,"He looked grave, but said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause.",BXS
ID,"With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has been, but is not.",BXS
ID,But the conditions of her are in no way aní_mic.,BXS
ID,"I have asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing.",BXS
ID,I know well what she will say.,BXS
ID,And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything.,BXS
ID,I must go back home and think.,BXS
ID,You must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again.,BXS
ID,"The disease--for not to be all well is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too.",BXS
ID,"She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.",BXS
ID,"'  ""As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.",BXS
ID,"And so now, Art, you know all I know.",BXS
ID,I shall keep stern watch.,BXS
ID,I trust your poor father is rallying.,BXS
ID,"It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you.",BXS
ID,"I know your idea of duty to your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from me"".",BXS
ID,Zoí_phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.,BXS
ID,He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time.,BXS
ID,Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless.,BXS
ID,"The attendant knew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.",BXS
ID,"Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him.",BXS
ID,"In about five minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now.",BXS
ID,"The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him.",BXS
ID,"Indeed, I can quite understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away.",BXS
ID,"It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly.",BXS
ID,I cannot quite understand it.,BXS
ID,Another change in my patient.,BXS
ID,"At five o'clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be.",BXS
ID,"He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding.",BXS
ID,"When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again.",BXS
ID,I thought it well to humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open.,BXS
ID,"He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies.",BXS
ID,"He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider.",BXS
ID,"I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise.",BXS
ID,"For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--  ""All over!",BXS
ID,all over!,BXS
ID,He has deserted me.,BXS
ID,"No hope for me now unless I do it for myself""!",BXS
ID,"Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said: ""Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar?",BXS
ID,"I think it would be good for me"".",BXS
ID,"""And the flies""?",BXS
ID,I said.,BXS
ID,"""Yes!",BXS
ID,"The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it"".",BXS
ID,And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue.,BXS
ID,"I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world.",BXS
ID,I wish I could fathom his mind.,BXS
ID,Another change in him.,BXS
ID,"I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling.",BXS
ID,"As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning.",BXS
ID,"It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all.",BXS
ID,"I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink.",BXS
ID,"As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor.",BXS
ID,"It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him.",BXS
ID,"I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do.",BXS
ID,"He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed.",BXS
ID,"All this surprised me, so I asked him: ""Are you not going to keep flies any more""?",BXS
ID,"""No,"" said he; ""I am sick of all that rubbish""!",BXS
ID,He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study.,BXS
ID,I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion.,BXS
ID,"Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset.",BXS
ID,Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?,BXS
ID,We shall see.,BXS
ID,Terrible change for the worse.,BXS
ID,Come at once; do not lose an hour.,BXS
ID,"I hold over telegram to Holmwood till have seen you"".",BXS
ID,"""My news to-day is not so good.",BXS
ID,Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.,BXS
ID,"There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about her.",BXS
ID,"I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak condition, might be disastrous to her.",BXS
ID,"We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall come through them all right.",BXS
ID,"If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for news.",BXS
ID,"In haste  The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was:--  ""Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her""?",BXS
ID,"""No,"" I said.",BXS
ID,"""I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram.",BXS
ID,"I wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be"".",BXS
ID,"""Right, my friend,"" he said, ""quite right!",BXS
ID,Better he not know as yet; perhaps he shall never know.,BXS
ID,"I pray so; but if it be needed, then he shall know all.",BXS
ID,"And, my good friend John, let me caution you.",BXS
ID,You deal with the madmen.,BXS
ID,"All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen, too--the rest of the world.",BXS
ID,You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not what you think.,BXS
ID,"So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it and breed.",BXS
ID,"You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here"".",BXS
ID,"He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way.",BXS
ID,"""I have for myself thoughts at the present.",BXS
ID,"Later I shall unfold to you"".",BXS
ID,"""Why not now""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""It may do some good; we may arrive at some decision"".",BXS
ID,"He stopped and looked at me, and said:--  ""My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: 'Look!",BXS
ID,he's good corn; he will make good crop when the time comes.,BXS
ID,"'"" I did not see the application, and told him so.",BXS
ID,"For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: ""The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then.",BXS
ID,"But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life.",BXS
ID,"See you now, friend John?",BXS
ID,"I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all, there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell"".",BXS
ID,"He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood.",BXS
ID,"Then he went on, and very gravely:--  ""You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest.",BXS
ID,"You were only student then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail.",BXS
ID,"Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.",BXS
ID,"Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say.",BXS
ID,Take then good note of it.,BXS
ID,Nothing is too small.,BXS
ID,"I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.",BXS
ID,Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess.,BXS
ID,"We learn from failure, not from success""!",BXS
ID,"When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing.",BXS
ID,"He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, ""the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade,"" as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft.",BXS
ID,"When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us.",BXS
ID,"She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her.",BXS
ID,Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors.,BXS
ID,"Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her.",BXS
ID,It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact.,BXS
ID,"If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of.",BXS
ID,"I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required.",BXS
ID,"She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room.,BXS
ID,"If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day.",BXS
ID,"She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.",BXS
ID,"Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent.",BXS
ID,"Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room.",BXS
ID,"The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open.",BXS
ID,Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door.,BXS
ID,"""My God""!",BXS
ID,"he said; ""this is dreadful.",BXS
ID,There is no time to be lost.,BXS
ID,She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be.,BXS
ID,There must be transfusion of blood at once.,BXS
ID,"Is it you or me""?",BXS
ID,"""I am younger and stronger, Professor.",BXS
ID,"It must be me"".",BXS
ID,"""Then get ready at once.",BXS
ID,I will bring up my bag.,BXS
ID,"I am prepared"".",BXS
ID,"I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door.",BXS
ID,"When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in.",BXS
ID,"He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper:--  ""Jack, I was so anxious.",BXS
ID,"I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony.",BXS
ID,"The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself.",BXS
ID,Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing?,BXS
ID,"I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming"".",BXS
ID,"When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.",BXS
ID,"Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand:--  ""Sir, you have come in time.",BXS
ID,You are the lover of our dear miss.,BXS
ID,"She is bad, very, very bad.",BXS
ID,"Nay, my child, do not go like that"".",BXS
ID,For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting.,BXS
ID,"""You are to help her.",BXS
ID,"You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help"".",BXS
ID,"""What can I do""?",BXS
ID,asked Arthur hoarsely.,BXS
ID,"""Tell me, and I shall do it.",BXS
ID,"My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--  ""My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last""!",BXS
ID,"""What shall I do""?",BXS
ID,"There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder.,BXS
ID,"""Come""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""You are a man, and it is a man we want.",BXS
ID,"You are better than me, better than my friend John"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--  ""Young miss is bad, very bad.",BXS
ID,"She wants blood, and blood she must have or die.",BXS
ID,My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him.,BXS
ID,"John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me""--here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence--""but, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought.",BXS
ID,"Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours""!",BXS
ID,"Arthur turned to him and said:--  ""If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand----""  He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.",BXS
ID,"""Good boy""!",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""In the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love.",BXS
ID,Come now and be silent.,BXS
ID,"You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you must leave at my sign.",BXS
ID,Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with her!,BXS
ID,There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one.,BXS
ID,"Come""!",BXS
ID,We all went up to Lucy's room.,BXS
ID,Arthur by direction remained outside.,BXS
ID,"Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing.",BXS
ID,"She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort.",BXS
ID,Her eyes spoke to us; that was all.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight.,BXS
ID,"Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--  ""Now, little miss, here is your medicine.",BXS
ID,"Drink it off, like a good child.",BXS
ID,"See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy.",BXS
ID,"Yes"".",BXS
ID,She had made the effort with success.,BXS
ID,It astonished me how long the drug took to act.,BXS
ID,"This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness.",BXS
ID,The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids.,BXS
ID,"At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep.",BXS
ID,"When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat.",BXS
ID,"Then he added: ""You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table.",BXS
ID,"Friend John, help to me""!",BXS
ID,So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing turning to me, said:  ""He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it"".",BXS
ID,"Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation.",BXS
ID,"As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.",BXS
ID,"After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was.",BXS
ID,It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.,BXS
ID,"But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.",BXS
ID,I could hear my own heart beat.,BXS
ID,"Presently he said in a soft voice: ""Do not stir an instant.",BXS
ID,It is enough.,BXS
ID,"You attend him; I will look to her"".",BXS
ID,When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened.,BXS
ID,"I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--  ""The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently"".",BXS
ID,"And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient's head.",BXS
ID,"As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat.",BXS
ID,"Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's ways of betraying emotion.",BXS
ID,"He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying: ""Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while.",BXS
ID,"He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love.",BXS
ID,He must not stay here.,BXS
ID,Hold!,BXS
ID,a moment.,BXS
ID,"I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result.",BXS
ID,Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful.,BXS
ID,"You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is.",BXS
ID,I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you have done.,BXS
ID,"Good-bye"".",BXS
ID,When Arthur had gone I went back to the room.,BXS
ID,"Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved.",BXS
ID,"By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.",BXS
ID,The velvet band again covered the red mark.,BXS
ID,"I asked the Professor in a whisper:--  ""What do you make of that mark on her throat""?",BXS
ID,"""What do you make of it""?",BXS
ID,"""I have not examined it yet,"" I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band.",BXS
ID,"Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking.",BXS
ID,"There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration.",BXS
ID,"It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be.",BXS
ID,The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.,BXS
ID,"""Well""?",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""Well,"" said I, ""I can make nothing of it"".",BXS
ID,The Professor stood up.,BXS
ID,"""I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""There are books and things there which I want.",BXS
ID,"You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her"".",BXS
ID,"""Shall I have a nurse""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.",BXS
ID,You must not sleep all the night.,BXS
ID,"Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible.",BXS
ID,"And then we may begin"".",BXS
ID,"""May begin""?",BXS
ID,I said.,BXS
ID,"""What on earth do you mean""?",BXS
ID,"""We shall see""!",BXS
ID,"he answered, as he hurried out.",BXS
ID,"He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:--  ""Remember, she is your charge.",BXS
ID,"If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter""!",BXS
ID,I sat up all night with Lucy.,BXS
ID,"The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation.",BXS
ID,"Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.",BXS
ID,"When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits.",BXS
ID,"I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.",BXS
ID,"When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside.",BXS
ID,"She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye.",BXS
ID,"After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off.",BXS
ID,"This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on.",BXS
ID,"It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--  ""You do not want to go to sleep""?",BXS
ID,"""No; I am afraid"".",BXS
ID,"""Afraid to go to sleep!",BXS
ID,Why so?,BXS
ID,"It is the boon we all crave for"".",BXS
ID,"""Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror""!",BXS
ID,"""A presage of horror!",BXS
ID,"What on earth do you mean""?",BXS
ID,"""I don't know; oh, I don't know.",BXS
ID,And that is what is so terrible.,BXS
ID,"All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought"".",BXS
ID,"""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night.",BXS
ID,"I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen"".",BXS
ID,"""Ah, I can trust you""!",BXS
ID,"I seized the opportunity, and said: ""I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once"".",BXS
ID,"""You will?",BXS
ID,"Oh, will you really?",BXS
ID,How good you are to me.,BXS
ID,"Then I will sleep""!",BXS
ID,"And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.",BXS
ID,All night long I watched by her.,BXS
ID,"She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep.",BXS
ID,"Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum.",BXS
ID,"There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.",BXS
ID,"In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things.",BXS
ID,"I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the operation.",BXS
ID,"My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my zoí_phagous patient.",BXS
ID,The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night.,BXS
ID,"A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning.",BXS
ID,I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham.,BXS
ID,"For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion.",BXS
ID,Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits.,BXS
ID,"When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--  ""No sitting up to-night for you.",BXS
ID,You are worn out.,BXS
ID,"I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you"".",BXS
ID,"I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper.",BXS
ID,"Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port.",BXS
ID,"Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.",BXS
ID,"""Now,"" she said, ""you must stay here.",BXS
ID,I shall leave this door open and my door too.,BXS
ID,You can lie on the sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon.,BXS
ID,"If I want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once"".",BXS
ID,"I could not but acquiesce, for I was ""dog-tired,"" and could not have sat up had I tried.",BXS
ID,"So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.",BXS
ID,I feel so happy to-night.,BXS
ID,"I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky.",BXS
ID,"Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me.",BXS
ID,I seem to feel his presence warm about me.,BXS
ID,"I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills.",BXS
ID,I know where my thoughts are.,BXS
ID,If Arthur only knew!,BXS
ID,"My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking.",BXS
ID,"Oh, the blissful rest of last night!",BXS
ID,"How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.",BXS
ID,"And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and within call.",BXS
ID,Thank everybody for being so good to me!,BXS
ID,Thank God!,BXS
ID,"Good-night, Arthur.",BXS
ID,"I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and started awake all in a second.",BXS
ID,"That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.",BXS
ID,"""And how is our patient""?",BXS
ID,"""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,"" I answered.",BXS
ID,"""Come, let us see,"" he said.",BXS
ID,And together we went into the room.,BXS
ID,"The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.",BXS
ID,"As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart.",BXS
ID,"As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, ""Gott in Himmel""!",BXS
ID,needed no enforcement from his agonised face.,BXS
ID,"He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white.",BXS
ID,I felt my knees begin to tremble.,BXS
ID,"There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever.",BXS
ID,"Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly.",BXS
ID,"""Quick""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""Bring the brandy"".",BXS
ID,"I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.",BXS
ID,"He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart.",BXS
ID,"He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:--  ""It is not too late.",BXS
ID,"It beats, though but feebly.",BXS
ID,All our work is undone; we must begin again.,BXS
ID,"There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John"".",BXS
ID,"As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve.",BXS
ID,"There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment's delay, we began the operation.",BXS
ID,"After a time--it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing held up a warning finger.",BXS
ID,"""Do not stir,"" he said, ""but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much danger.",BXS
ID,But I shall precaution take.,BXS
ID,"I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia"".",BXS
ID,"He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent.",BXS
ID,"The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep.",BXS
ID,It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips.,BXS
ID,"No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.",BXS
ID,The Professor watched me critically.,BXS
ID,"""That will do,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""Already""?",BXS
ID,I remonstrated.,BXS
ID,"""You took a great deal more from Art"".",BXS
ID,"To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--  ""He is her lover, her _fiancí©_.",BXS
ID,"You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will suffice"".",BXS
ID,"When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision.",BXS
ID,"I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick.",BXS
ID,"By-and-by he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself.",BXS
ID,"As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered:--  ""Mind, nothing must be said of this.",BXS
ID,"If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him.",BXS
ID,"It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too.",BXS
ID,There must be none.,BXS
ID,"So""!",BXS
ID,"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--  ""You are not much the worse.",BXS
ID,"Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me"".",BXS
ID,"I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were.",BXS
ID,"I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength.",BXS
ID,"I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred.",BXS
ID,"I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it.",BXS
ID,"I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges--tiny though they were.",BXS
ID,"Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before.",BXS
ID,"When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment.",BXS
ID,"I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.",BXS
ID,"Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened.",BXS
ID,I tried to keep her amused and interested.,BXS
ID,"When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully:--  ""We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself.",BXS
ID,You are looking pale yourself.,BXS
ID,"You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do""!",BXS
ID,"As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head.",BXS
ID,The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me.,BXS
ID,"I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: ""Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough.",BXS
ID,Make yourself strong.,BXS
ID,"I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself.",BXS
ID,"You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know.",BXS
ID,I have grave reasons.,BXS
ID,"No, do not ask them; think what you will.",BXS
ID,Do not fear to think even the most not-probable.,BXS
ID,"Good-night"".",BXS
ID,"In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,"They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the ""foreign gentleman"".",BXS
ID,I was much touched by their kindness.,BXS
ID,"Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman's kindness.",BXS
ID,I got back here in time for a late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep.,BXS
ID,It is coming.,BXS
ID,This afternoon I went over to Hillingham.,BXS
ID,"Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better.",BXS
ID,"Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor.",BXS
ID,"He opened it with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of white flowers.",BXS
ID,"""These are for you, Miss Lucy,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""For me?",BXS
ID,"Oh, Dr. Van Helsing""!",BXS
ID,"""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with.",BXS
ID,"These are medicines"".",BXS
ID,Here Lucy made a wry face.,BXS
ID,"""Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort.",BXS
ID,"Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again.",BXS
ID,"This is medicinal, but you do not know how.",BXS
ID,"I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well.",BXS
ID,Oh yes!,BXS
ID,"they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten.",BXS
ID,"It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late"".",BXS
ID,"Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them.",BXS
ID,"Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and half-disgust:--  ""Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.",BXS
ID,"Why, these flowers are only common garlic"".",BXS
ID,"To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--  ""No trifling with me!",BXS
ID,I never jest!,BXS
ID,There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me.,BXS
ID,"Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own"".",BXS
ID,"Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently: ""Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me.",BXS
ID,I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers.,BXS
ID,"See, I place them myself in your room.",BXS
ID,I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.,BXS
ID,But hush!,BXS
ID,no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions.,BXS
ID,"We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience; and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you.",BXS
ID,Now sit still awhile.,BXS
ID,"Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.",BXS
ID,"I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here"".",BXS
ID,"We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.",BXS
ID,The Professor's actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of.,BXS
ID,"First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell.",BXS
ID,"Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way.",BXS
ID,"It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:--  ""Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me.",BXS
ID,"It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit"".",BXS
ID,"""Perhaps I am""!",BXS
ID,he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.,BXS
ID,"We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck.",BXS
ID,"The last words he said to her were:--  ""Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the door"".",BXS
ID,"""I promise,"" said Lucy, ""and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me!",BXS
ID,"Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends""?",BXS
ID,"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--  ""To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink.",BXS
ID,"To-morrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my 'spell' which I have work.",BXS
ID,Ho!,BXS
ID,"ho""!",BXS
ID,"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror.",BXS
ID,"It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.",BXS
ID,How good they all are to me.,BXS
ID,I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers.,BXS
ID,"He positively frightened me, he was so fierce.",BXS
ID,"And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from them already.",BXS
ID,"Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear.",BXS
ID,I shall not mind any flapping outside the window.,BXS
ID,"Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has for me!",BXS
ID,"How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams.",BXS
ID,"Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with ""virgin crants and maiden strewments"".",BXS
ID,"I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!",BXS
ID,There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already.,BXS
ID,"Good-night, everybody.",BXS
ID,"Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time.",BXS
ID,The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting.,BXS
ID,"The Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.",BXS
ID,Let all be put down exactly.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at eight o'clock.,BXS
ID,It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work.,BXS
ID,"The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours, but had not yet begun to drop from the trees.",BXS
ID,When we entered we met Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room.,BXS
ID,She is always an early riser.,BXS
ID,"She greeted us warmly and said:--  ""You will be glad to know that Lucy is better.",BXS
ID,The dear child is still asleep.,BXS
ID,"I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I should disturb her"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant.",BXS
ID,"He rubbed his hands together, and said:--  ""Aha!",BXS
ID,I thought I had diagnosed the case.,BXS
ID,"My treatment is working,"" to which she answered:--  ""You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor.",BXS
ID,"Lucy's state this morning is due in part to me"".",BXS
ID,"""How you do mean, ma'am""?",BXS
ID,asked the Professor.,BXS
ID,"""Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room.",BXS
ID,She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did not wake her.,BXS
ID,But the room was awfully stuffy.,BXS
ID,"There were a lot of those horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck.",BXS
ID,"I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air.",BXS
ID,"You will be pleased with her, I am sure"".",BXS
ID,"She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early.",BXS
ID,"As she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen grey.",BXS
ID,"He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be; he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room.",BXS
ID,"But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.",BXS
ID,"Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down.",BXS
ID,"He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart.",BXS
ID,"Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe.",BXS
ID,"""God!",BXS
ID,God!,BXS
ID,"God""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset?",BXS
ID,"Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way?",BXS
ID,"This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die.",BXS
ID,"Oh, how we are beset!",BXS
ID,"How are all the powers of the devils against us""!",BXS
ID,Suddenly he jumped to his feet.,BXS
ID,"""Come,"" he said, ""come, we must see and act.",BXS
ID,"Devils or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him all the same"".",BXS
ID,He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we went up to Lucy's room.,BXS
ID,"Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.",BXS
ID,"This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before.",BXS
ID,He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity.,BXS
ID,"""As I expected,"" he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much.",BXS
ID,"Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood.",BXS
ID,"I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand.",BXS
ID,"""No""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""To-day you must operate.",BXS
ID,I shall provide.,BXS
ID,"You are weakened already"".",BXS
ID,As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve.,BXS
ID,"Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep.",BXS
ID,This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.,BXS
ID,"Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure.",BXS
ID,"Then he took over the care of the case himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come.",BXS
ID,"After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.",BXS
ID,What does it all mean?,BXS
ID,I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.,BXS
ID,Four days and nights of peace.,BXS
ID,I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself.,BXS
ID,"It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me.",BXS
ID,"I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water.",BXS
ID,"Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased.",BXS
ID,I go to bed now without any fear of sleep.,BXS
ID,I do not even try to keep awake.,BXS
ID,"I have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem.",BXS
ID,"To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam.",BXS
ID,But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone.,BXS
ID,"Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our friends who have been so kind!",BXS
ID,"I shall not even feel the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time.",BXS
ID,"I found him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window-panes.",BXS
ID,"After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words ""Pall Mall Gazette"" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoí_logical Gardens in which the wolf department is included.",BXS
ID,"Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him.",BXS
ID,"Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable.",BXS
ID,"The keeper would not enter on what he called ""business"" until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied.",BXS
ID,"Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--  ""Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want.",BXS
ID,You'll excoose me refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals.,BXS
ID,"I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions"".",BXS
ID,"""How do you mean, ask them questions""?",BXS
ID,"I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.",BXS
ID,"""'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals.",BXS
ID,"I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin'.",BXS
ID,"Mind you,"" he added philosophically, ""there's a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles.",BXS
ID,"Here's you a-comin' and arskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd answer.",BXS

ID,"Without offence did I tell yer to go to 'ell""?",BXS
ID,"""You did"".",BXS
ID,"""An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language that was 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right.",BXS

ID,"""Exactly.",BXS

ID,"""All right, guv'nor.",BXS
ID,This 'ere is about the 'ole story.,BXS
ID,"That 'ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago.",BXS
ID,"He was a nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of.",BXS

ID,I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem away straight.,BXS
ID,There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out.,BXS
ID,"There wasn't much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it.",BXS
ID,"He had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at.",BXS
ID,"He 'ad white kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says: 'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.",BXS
ID,"'  ""'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give 'isself.",BXS

ID,"That's all"".",BXS
ID,"I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length with surprise.",BXS
ID,"""God bless me""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""If there ain't old Bersicker come back by 'isself""!",BXS
ID,He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me.,BXS
ID,I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.,BXS
ID,"After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog.",BXS
ID,"The animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.",BXS
ID,The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos.,BXS
ID,"The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son.",BXS
ID,"Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--  ""There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble; didn't I say it all along?",BXS

ID,'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other.,BXS
ID,It's a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.,BXS
ID,This 'ere's what comes of it.,BXS
ID,"Come along, Bersicker"".",BXS
ID,"He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.",BXS
ID,"I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.",BXS
ID,"I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion.",BXS
ID,"I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown.",BXS
ID,Without an instant's pause he made straight at me.,BXS
ID,"He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us.",BXS
ID,"He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.",BXS
ID,"Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor.",BXS
ID,"My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet.",BXS
ID,"I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time.",BXS
ID,"When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me.",BXS
ID,"He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist.",BXS
ID,"He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: ""The blood is the life!",BXS
ID,"The blood is the life""!",BXS
ID,"I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's illness and its horrible phases is telling on me.",BXS
ID,"I am over-excited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest.",BXS
ID,"Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without it.",BXS
ID,Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night.,BXS
ID,"If not watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as placed; very important; do not fail.",BXS
ID,"Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival"".",BXS
ID,Just off for train to London.,BXS
ID,The arrival of Van Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay.,BXS
ID,"A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night.",BXS
ID,"Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened?",BXS
ID,Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do.,BXS
ID,"I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.",BXS
ID,"I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me.",BXS
ID,This is an exact record of what took place to-night.,BXS
ID,"I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.",BXS
ID,"I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.",BXS
ID,"I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well.",BXS
ID,"I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have called him.",BXS
ID,"I tried to go to sleep, but could not.",BXS
ID,"Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake.",BXS
ID,"Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: ""Is there anybody there""?",BXS
ID,There was no answer.,BXS
ID,"I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.",BXS
ID,"Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but more fierce and deeper.",BXS
ID,"I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window.",BXS
ID,"So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep.",BXS
ID,"Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me.",BXS
ID,"She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--  ""I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right"".",BXS
ID,"I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed.",BXS
ID,"As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again.",BXS
ID,"She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: ""What is that""?",BXS
ID,"I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly.",BXS
ID,"After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.",BXS
ID,"The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf.",BXS
ID,"Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her.",BXS
ID,"Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me.",BXS
ID,"For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two.",BXS
ID,The room and all round seemed to spin round.,BXS
ID,"I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert.",BXS
ID,"I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body, which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.",BXS
ID,"The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again.",BXS
ID,"Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing.",BXS
ID,"I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me.",BXS
ID,"The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door.",BXS
ID,"I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out.",BXS
ID,"The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to.",BXS
ID,"They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up.",BXS
ID,They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine.,BXS
ID,The door flew open for an instant and closed again.,BXS
ID,"The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mother's breast.",BXS
ID,"When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now.",BXS
ID,I was surprised that the maids did not come back.,BXS
ID,"I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the dining-room to look for them.",BXS
ID,My heart sank when I saw what had happened.,BXS
ID,"They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily.",BXS
ID,"The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about.",BXS
ID,"I was suspicious, and examined the decanter.",BXS
ID,"It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for her--oh!",BXS
ID,did use--was empty.,BXS
ID,What am I to do?,BXS
ID,what am I to do?,BXS
ID,I am back in the room with mother.,BXS
ID,"I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged.",BXS
ID,Alone with the dead!,BXS
ID,"I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window.",BXS
ID,"The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim.",BXS
ID,What am I to do?,BXS
ID,God shield me from harm this night!,BXS
ID,"I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out.",BXS
ID,My dear mother gone!,BXS
ID,It is time that I go too.,BXS
ID,"Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night.",BXS
ID,"God keep you, dear, and God help me!",BXS
ID,I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.,BXS
ID,"Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone.",BXS
ID,"I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door.",BXS
ID,"After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer.",BXS
ID,"I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response.",BXS
ID,"Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me.",BXS
ID,Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us?,BXS
ID,"Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late?",BXS
ID,"I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses; and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere.",BXS
ID,I could find no means of ingress.,BXS
ID,"Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch.",BXS
ID,"As I did so, I heard the rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet.",BXS
ID,"They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.",BXS
ID,"When he saw me, he gasped out:--  ""Then it was you, and just arrived.",BXS
ID,How is she?,BXS
ID,Are we too late?,BXS
ID,"Did you not get my telegram""?",BXS
ID,"I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me.",BXS
ID,"He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly:--  ""Then I fear we are too late.",BXS
ID,"God's will be done""!",BXS
ID,"With his usual recuperative energy, he went on: ""Come.",BXS
ID,"If there be no way open to get in, we must make one.",BXS
ID,"Time is all in all to us now"".",BXS
ID,"We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window.",BXS
ID,"The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window.",BXS
ID,I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them.,BXS
ID,"Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window.",BXS
ID,"I helped the Professor in, and followed him.",BXS
ID,"There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at hand.",BXS
ID,"We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor.",BXS
ID,"There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said: ""We can attend to them later"".",BXS
ID,Then we ascended to Lucy's room.,BXS
ID,"For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear.",BXS
ID,"With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room.",BXS
ID,How shall I describe what we saw?,BXS
ID,"On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother.",BXS
ID,"The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it.",BXS
ID,"By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn.",BXS
ID,"The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.",BXS
ID,"Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--  ""It is not yet too late!",BXS
ID,Quick!,BXS
ID,quick!,BXS
ID,"Bring the brandy""!",BXS
ID,"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table.",BXS
ID,"The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off.",BXS
ID,"I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,"He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands.",BXS
ID,"He said to me:--  ""I can do this, all that can be at the present.",BXS
ID,You go wake those maids.,BXS
ID,"Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard.",BXS
ID,Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath.,BXS
ID,This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her.,BXS
ID,"She will need be heated before we can do anything more"".",BXS
ID,"I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women.",BXS
ID,"The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep.",BXS
ID,"The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner.",BXS
ID,"I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk.",BXS
ID,"I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,"So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water.",BXS
ID,"Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water.",BXS
ID,We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it.,BXS
ID,Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door.,BXS
ID,"One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it.",BXS
ID,Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood.,BXS
ID,"I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now.",BXS
ID,"She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.",BXS
ID,I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest.,BXS
ID,"I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so.",BXS
ID,"He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--  ""If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon"".",BXS
ID,"He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.",BXS
ID,Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect.,BXS
ID,"Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing's face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--  ""The first gain is ours!",BXS
ID,"Check to the King""!",BXS
ID,"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat.",BXS
ID,I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat.,BXS
ID,"She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.",BXS
ID,"""We must consult as to what is to be done,"" he said as we descended the stairs.",BXS
ID,"In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him.",BXS
ID,"The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes.",BXS
ID,"The room was, therefore, dimly dark.",BXS
ID,"It was, however, light enough for our purposes.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity.,BXS
ID,"He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--  ""What are we to do now?",BXS
ID,Where are we to turn for help?,BXS
ID,"We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life won't be worth an hour's purchase.",BXS
ID,You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too.,BXS
ID,"I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit.",BXS
ID,"What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her""?",BXS
ID,"""What's the matter with me, anyhow""?",BXS
ID,"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: ""Quincey Morris""!",BXS
ID,and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.,BXS
ID,"""What brought you here""?",BXS
ID,I cried as our hands met.,BXS
ID,"""I guess Art is the cause"".",BXS
ID,"He handed me a telegram:--  ""Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.",BXS
ID,Cannot leave.,BXS
ID,Father still in same condition.,BXS
ID,Send me word how Lucy is.,BXS
ID,Do not delay.,BXS
ID,"--HOLMWOOD"".",BXS
ID,"""I think I came just in the nick of time.",BXS
ID,"You know you have only to tell me what to do"".",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:--  ""A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble.",BXS
ID,You're a man and no mistake.,BXS
ID,"Well, the devil may work against us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them"".",BXS
ID,Once again we went through that ghastly operation.,BXS
ID,I have not the heart to go through with the details.,BXS
ID,"Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions.",BXS
ID,Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear.,BXS
ID,"However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect.",BXS
ID,Her faint became a profound slumber.,BXS
ID,"The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting.",BXS
ID,"I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast.",BXS
ID,"Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was.",BXS
ID,"When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand.",BXS
ID,"He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow.",BXS
ID,"There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.",BXS
ID,"He handed me the paper saying only: ""It dropped from Lucy's breast when we carried her to the bath"".",BXS
ID,"When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: ""In God's name, what does it all mean?",BXS
ID,"Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it""?",BXS
ID,I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:--  ""Do not trouble about it now.",BXS
ID,Forget it for the present.,BXS
ID,You shall know and understand it all in good time; but it will be later.,BXS
ID,"And now what is it that you came to me to say""?",BXS
ID,"This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again.",BXS
ID,"""I came to speak about the certificate of death.",BXS
ID,"If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced.",BXS
ID,"I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did.",BXS
ID,"I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it.",BXS
ID,"Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker"".",BXS
ID,"""Good, oh my friend John!",BXS
ID,Well thought of!,BXS
ID,"Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her.",BXS
ID,"One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man.",BXS
ID,"Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind!",BXS
ID,I love you all the more for it!,BXS
ID,"Now go"".",BXS
ID,"In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her.",BXS
ID,"I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--  ""When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves""?",BXS
ID,I nodded in reply and went out.,BXS
ID,"I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.",BXS
ID,When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.,BXS
ID,"I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room.",BXS
ID,"She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side.",BXS
ID,"From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.",BXS
ID,"So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.",BXS
ID,"When we were alone, he said to me:--  ""Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no right to be; but this is no ordinary case.",BXS
ID,"You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't help feeling anxious about her all the same.",BXS
ID,What is it that's wrong with her?,BXS
ID,"The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have _another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.",BXS
ID,"Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private.",BXS
ID,"But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part.",BXS
ID,"Is not that so""?",BXS
ID,"""That's so,"" I said, and he went on:--  ""I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day.",BXS
ID,"Is not that so""?",BXS
ID,"""That's so"".",BXS
ID,"""And I guess Art was in it too.",BXS
ID,When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer.,BXS
ID,I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night.,BXS
ID,"One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay.",BXS
ID,"Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so""?",BXS
ID,As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.,BXS
ID,"He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.",BXS
ID,"His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down.",BXS
ID,"I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: ""That's so"".",BXS
ID,"""And how long has this been going on""?",BXS
ID,"""About ten days"".",BXS
ID,"""Ten days!",BXS
ID,"Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men.",BXS
ID,"Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it"".",BXS
ID,"Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: ""What took it out""?",BXS
ID,I shook my head.,BXS
ID,"""That,"" I said, ""is the crux.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end.",BXS
ID,I can't even hazard a guess.,BXS
ID,There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.,BXS
ID,But these shall not occur again.,BXS
ID,"Here we stay until all be well--or ill"".",BXS
ID,Quincey held out his hand.,BXS
ID,"""Count me in,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and I'll do it"".",BXS
ID,"When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read.",BXS
ID,"The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.",BXS
ID,"Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.",BXS
ID,"Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face.",BXS
ID,We both understood what that meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried what we could to comfort her.,BXS
ID,"Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time.",BXS
ID,"We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her.",BXS
ID,Towards dusk she fell into a doze.,BXS
ID,Here a very odd thing occurred.,BXS
ID,Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her.,BXS
ID,"All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.",BXS
ID,"All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.",BXS
ID,"The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended.",BXS
ID,"Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.",BXS
ID,"When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's strength.",BXS
ID,"She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.",BXS
ID,"At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking.",BXS
ID,"Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one.",BXS
ID,"In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.",BXS
ID,Quincey went off to meet him at the station.,BXS
ID,"When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks.",BXS
ID,"When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak.",BXS
ID,"In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened.",BXS
ID,"Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived.",BXS
ID,"He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.",BXS
ID,"It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her.",BXS
ID,"I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy's phonograph.",BXS
ID,Until six o'clock they are to try to rest.,BXS
ID,"I fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great; the poor child cannot rally.",BXS
ID,God help us all.,BXS
ID,"""It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote.",BXS
ID,"You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news.",BXS
ID,"Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins.",BXS
ID,"He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.",BXS
ID,"After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--  ""'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both.",BXS
ID,"I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up.",BXS
ID,Now I want you to make your home here with me.,BXS
ID,"I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.",BXS
ID,"' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands.",BXS
ID,"Our evening was a very, very happy one.",BXS
ID,"""So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks--and humans.",BXS
ID,"I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients.",BXS
ID,"""How is your dear mother getting on?",BXS
ID,"I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still.",BXS
ID,"He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity.",BXS
ID,"However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.",BXS
ID,"And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours.",BXS
ID,"When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding?",BXS
ID,"Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan asks me to send his 'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead.",BXS
ID,"Good-bye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.",BXS
ID,"""In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.",BXS
ID,"With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say.",BXS
ID,"He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results.",BXS
ID,"This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away.",BXS
ID,"The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers.",BXS
ID,"I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house.",BXS
ID,"As he passed the window of Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to.",BXS
ID,"The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to ""shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,"" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it.",BXS
ID,"I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse.",BXS
ID,I pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild beast like that.,BXS
ID,"' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man.",BXS
ID,"I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.",BXS
ID,"I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner.",BXS
ID,"I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair.",BXS
ID,"It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again.",BXS
ID,"This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue.",BXS
ID,"I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief.",BXS
ID,"My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes.",BXS
ID,"The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise.",BXS
ID,"Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground.",BXS
ID,If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then.,BXS
ID,The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip.,BXS
ID,"It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens.",BXS
ID,"You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men.",BXS
ID,"At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them!",BXS
ID,They shan't rob me!,BXS
ID,they shan't murder me by inches!,BXS
ID,I'll fight for my Lord and Master!,BXS
ID,' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings.,BXS
ID,It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room.,BXS
ID,"One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken.",BXS
ID,"However, I set it all right; and he is going on well.",BXS
ID,"""The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us.",BXS
ID,"Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman.",BXS
ID,They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him.,BXS
ID,They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment.,BXS
ID,"I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent.",BXS
ID,"I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed.",BXS
ID,"They are as follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green.",BXS
ID,"They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.",BXS
ID,"""I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance.",BXS
ID,"""Such a sad blow has befallen us.",BXS
ID,Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.,BXS
ID,"Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father.",BXS
ID,"I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.",BXS
ID,Jonathan is greatly distressed.,BXS
ID,"It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account.",BXS
ID,He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous.,BXS
ID,He begins to doubt himself.,BXS
ID,"I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_ helps him to have a belief in himself.",BXS
ID,But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.,BXS
ID,"Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone.",BXS
ID,"Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in.",BXS
ID,"I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father.",BXS
ID,"As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner.",BXS
ID,"I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few minutes.",BXS
ID,Forgive me for troubling you.,BXS
ID,"With all blessings,  Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night.",BXS
ID,"I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.",BXS
ID,"And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother and Arthur's father, and now.",BXS
ID,Let me get on with my work.,BXS
ID,I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.,BXS
ID,"We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.",BXS
ID,"It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing was very kind to him.,BXS
ID,"""Come, my child,"" he said; ""come with me.",BXS
ID,"You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of.",BXS
ID,You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.,BXS
ID,"Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas.",BXS
ID,"You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.",BXS
ID,"She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be.",BXS
ID,"I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers.",BXS
ID,"Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.",BXS
ID,"Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning.",BXS
ID,"In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.",BXS
ID,"I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily.",BXS
ID,At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window.,BXS
ID,"I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind.",BXS
ID,"There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now and again struck the window with its wings.",BXS
ID,"When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat.",BXS
ID,"I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.",BXS
ID,"Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.",BXS
ID,"She took but a little, and that languidly.",BXS
ID,There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness.,BXS
ID,It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her.,BXS
ID,"It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close.",BXS
ID,"There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.",BXS
ID,At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.,BXS
ID,"Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.",BXS
ID,"When he saw Lucy's face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper: ""Draw up the blind; I want light""!",BXS
ID,"Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully.",BXS
ID,He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.,BXS
ID,"As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, ""Mein Gott""!",BXS
ID,as it was smothered in his throat.,BXS
ID,"I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.",BXS
ID,The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.,BXS
ID,"For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest.",BXS
ID,"Then he turned to me and said calmly:--  ""She is dying.",BXS
ID,It will not be long now.,BXS
ID,"It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep.",BXS
ID,"Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him"".",BXS
ID,I went to the dining-room and waked him.,BXS
ID,"He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear.",BXS
ID,"I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near.",BXS
ID,"He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief.",BXS
ID,I took him by the hand and raised him up.,BXS
ID,"""Come,"" I said, ""my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her"".",BXS
ID,"When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible.",BXS
ID,"He had even brushed Lucy's hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.",BXS
ID,"When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:--  ""Arthur!",BXS
ID,"Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come""!",BXS
ID,"He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back.",BXS
ID,"""No,"" he whispered, ""not yet!",BXS
ID,"Hold her hand; it will comfort her more"".",BXS
ID,"So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.",BXS
ID,"Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.",BXS
ID,"For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.",BXS
ID,And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night.,BXS
ID,"Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.",BXS
ID,"In a sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:--  ""Arthur!",BXS
ID,"Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!",BXS
ID,"Kiss me""!",BXS
ID,"Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.",BXS
ID,"""Not for your life""!",BXS
ID,"he said; ""not for your living soul and hers""!",BXS
ID,And he stood between them like a lion at bay.,BXS
ID,"Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.",BXS
ID,"I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed together.",BXS
ID,"Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.",BXS
ID,"Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it.",BXS
ID,"""My true friend,"" she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, ""My true friend, and his!",BXS
ID,"Oh, guard him, and give me peace""!",BXS
ID,"""I swear it""!",BXS
ID,"he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath.",BXS
ID,"Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him: ""Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once"".",BXS
ID,Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.,BXS
ID,"Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur's arm, and drew him away.",BXS
ID,"And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.",BXS
ID,"""It is all over,"" said Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,"""She is dead""!",BXS
ID,"I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.",BXS
ID,"I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever.",BXS
ID,Some change had come over her body.,BXS
ID,"Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor.",BXS
ID,"It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.",BXS
ID,"""We thought her dying whilst she slept,         And sleeping when she died"".",BXS
ID,"I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--  ""Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last.",BXS
ID,"It is the end""!",BXS
ID,"He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--  ""Not so; alas!",BXS
ID,not so.,BXS
ID,"It is only the beginning""!",BXS
ID,"When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--  ""We can do nothing as yet.",BXS
ID,"Wait and see"".",BXS
ID,"The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother might be buried together.",BXS
ID,"I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.",BXS
ID,"Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from the death-chamber:--  ""She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.",BXS
ID,It's quite a privilege to attend on her.,BXS
ID,"It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment""!",BXS
ID,I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.,BXS
ID,This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household.,BXS
ID,"There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden.",BXS
ID,"Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc.",BXS
ID,He insisted upon looking over Lucy's papers himself.,BXS
ID,"I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble.",BXS
ID,"He answered me:--  ""I know; I know.",BXS
ID,You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor.,BXS
ID,But this is not altogether for the law.,BXS
ID,"You knew that, when you avoided the coroner.",BXS
ID,I have more than him to avoid.,BXS
ID,"There may be papers more--such as this"".",BXS
ID,"As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.",BXS
ID,"""When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night.",BXS
ID,"For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself search for what may be.",BXS
ID,"It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers"".",BXS
ID,"I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to him.",BXS
ID,All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given.,BXS
ID,"I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:--  ""Can I help you, friend John?",BXS
ID,"I am free, and if I may, my service is to you"".",BXS
ID,"""Have you got what you looked for""?",BXS
ID,"I asked, to which he replied:--  ""I did not look for any specific thing.",BXS
ID,"I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun.",BXS
ID,"But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them.",BXS
ID,"I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some"".",BXS
ID,"When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--  ""And now, friend John, I think we may to bed.",BXS
ID,"We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate.",BXS
ID,"To-morrow we shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us.",BXS
ID,"Alas""!",BXS
ID,Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.,BXS
ID,"The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small _chapelle ardente_.",BXS
ID,"There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be.",BXS
ID,"The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.",BXS
ID,"All Lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of ""decay's effacing fingers,"" had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.",BXS
ID,The Professor looked sternly grave.,BXS
ID,"He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.",BXS
ID,"He said to me: ""Remain till I return,"" and left the room.",BXS
ID,"He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed.",BXS
ID,"Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth.",BXS
ID,"He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away.",BXS
ID,"I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--  ""To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives"".",BXS
ID,"""Must we make an autopsy""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""Yes and no.",BXS
ID,"I want to operate, but not as you think.",BXS
ID,"Let me tell you now, but not a word to another.",BXS
ID,I want to cut off her head and take out her heart.,BXS
ID,Ah!,BXS
ID,"you a surgeon, and so shocked!",BXS
ID,"You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder.",BXS
ID,"Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help.",BXS
ID,"I would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow, and he will want to see her--to see _it_.",BXS
ID,"Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.",BXS
ID,"We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone"".",BXS
ID,"""But why do it at all?",BXS
ID,The girl is dead.,BXS
ID,Why mutilate her poor body without need?,BXS
ID,"And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge--why do it?",BXS
ID,"Without such it is monstrous"".",BXS
ID,"For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:--  ""Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more because it does so bleed.",BXS
ID,"If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear.",BXS
ID,"But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things.",BXS
ID,"John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause?",BXS
ID,I may err--I am but man; but I believe in all I do.,BXS
ID,Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came?,BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was dying--and snatched him away by all my strength?",BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?",BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"""Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do.",BXS
ID,"You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt.",BXS
ID,"Believe me yet a little, friend John.",BXS
ID,"If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well.",BXS
ID,"And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh!",BXS
ID,"so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be""!",BXS
ID,"He paused a moment and went on solemnly: ""Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us.",BXS
ID,"Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end.",BXS
ID,"Will you not have faith in me""?",BXS
ID,"I took his hand, and promised him.",BXS
ID,"I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door.",BXS
ID,"As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy lay.",BXS
ID,The sight touched me.,BXS
ID,"Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love.",BXS
ID,"Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest.",BXS
ID,"I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.",BXS
ID,"He came over to my bedside and said:--  ""You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it"".",BXS
ID,"""Why not""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me.,BXS
ID,"""Because,"" he said sternly, ""it is too late--or too early.",BXS
ID,"See""!",BXS
ID,Here he held up the little golden crucifix.,BXS
ID,"""This was stolen in the night"".",BXS
ID,"""How, stolen,"" I asked in wonder, ""since you have it now""?",BXS
ID,"""Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living.",BXS
ID,"Her punishment will surely come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing, she only stole.",BXS
ID,"Now we must wait"".",BXS
ID,"He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with.",BXS
ID,"The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale.",BXS
ID,"He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details.",BXS
ID,"During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood.",BXS
ID,"When he had told us so much he went on:--  ""Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance.",BXS
ID,"Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes.",BXS
ID,"Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.",BXS
ID,"We were right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.",BXS
ID,"Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes.",BXS
ID,"For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been treated at her decease as under intestacy.",BXS
ID,"In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.",BXS
ID,"I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced"".",BXS
ID,"He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.",BXS
ID,"He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming.",BXS
ID,"His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts.",BXS
ID,"Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber.",BXS
ID,"It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.",BXS
ID,"The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancí©e_ quite alone.",BXS
ID,"The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved.",BXS
ID,Poor fellow!,BXS
ID,He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much-tried emotions.,BXS
ID,"He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him.",BXS
ID,"With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him.",BXS
ID,"The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs.",BXS
ID,"I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:--  ""You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you.",BXS
ID,I don't know how to thank you for all you have done for her.,BXS
ID,I can't think yet.,BXS
ID,"Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast, crying:--  ""Oh, Jack!",BXS
ID,Jack!,BXS
ID,What shall I do!,BXS
ID,"The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for"".",BXS
ID,I comforted him as well as I could.,BXS
ID,In such cases men do not need much expression.,BXS
ID,"A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's heart.",BXS
ID,"I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him:--  ""Come and look at her"".",BXS
ID,"Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.",BXS
ID,God!,BXS
ID,how beautiful she was.,BXS
ID,Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness.,BXS
ID,"It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.",BXS
ID,"At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--  ""Jack, is she really dead""?",BXS
ID,"I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering.",BXS
ID,"It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside.",BXS
ID,"I told him that that must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead.",BXS
ID,"He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.",BXS
ID,"I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin.",BXS
ID,"When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he replied:--  ""I am not surprised.",BXS
ID,"Just now I doubted for a moment myself""!",BXS
ID,"We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but when we had lit our cigars he said--  ""Lord----""; but Arthur interrupted him:--  ""No, no, not that, for God's sake!",BXS
ID,not yet at any rate.,BXS
ID,"Forgive me, sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so recent"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor answered very sweetly:--  ""I only used that name because I was in doubt.",BXS
ID,"I must not call you 'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as Arthur"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.",BXS
ID,"""Call me what you will,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""I hope I may always have the title of a friend.",BXS
ID,"And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear"".",BXS
ID,"He paused a moment, and went on: ""I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember""--the Professor nodded--""you must forgive me"".",BXS
ID,"He answered with a grave kindness:--  ""I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand.",BXS
ID,And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may not--and must not yet understand.,BXS
ID,"But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through.",BXS
ID,"Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect"".",BXS
ID,"""And, indeed, indeed, sir,"" said Arthur warmly, ""I shall in all ways trust you.",BXS
ID,"I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jack's friend, and you were hers.",BXS
ID,"You shall do what you like"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:--  ""May I ask you something now""?",BXS
ID,"""Certainly"".",BXS
ID,"""You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property""?",BXS
ID,"""No, poor dear; I never thought of it"".",BXS
ID,"""And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.",BXS
ID,I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and letters.,BXS
ID,"Believe me, it is no idle curiosity.",BXS
ID,"I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved.",BXS
ID,I have them all here.,BXS
ID,"I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them--no strange eye look through words into her soul.",BXS
ID,"I shall keep them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe.",BXS
ID,No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to you.,BXS
ID,"It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy's sake""?",BXS
ID,"Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will.",BXS
ID,I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved.,BXS
ID,"I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes"".",BXS
ID,"The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--  ""And you are right.",BXS
ID,"There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last.",BXS
ID,"We and you too--you most of all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet.",BXS
ID,"But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well""!",BXS
ID,I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing did not go to bed at all.,BXS
ID,"He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.",BXS
ID,"It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another attack that may harm him.",BXS
ID,Some day he may ask me about it.,BXS
ID,Down it all goes.,BXS
ID,I am rusty in my shorthand--see what unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow.,BXS
ID,The service was very simple and very solemn.,BXS
ID,"There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the Incorporated Law Society.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us.",BXS
ID,"We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs.",BXS
ID,It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.,BXS
ID,"Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school.",BXS
ID,"I felt it very improper, for you can't go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't care if they did--so on we walked.",BXS
ID,"I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: ""My God""!",BXS
ID,"I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.",BXS
ID,"He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl.",BXS
ID,"He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him.",BXS
ID,"His face was not a good face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice.",BXS
ID,"I feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty.",BXS
ID,"I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: ""Do you see who it is""?",BXS
ID,"""No, dear,"" I said; ""I don't know him; who is it""?",BXS
ID,"His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--  ""It is the man himself""!",BXS
ID,The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down.,BXS
ID,"He kept staring; a man came out of the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off.",BXS
ID,"The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--  ""I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young.",BXS
ID,"My God, if this be so!",BXS
ID,"Oh, my God!",BXS
ID,my God!,BXS
ID,If I only knew!,BXS
ID,"if I only knew""!",BXS
ID,"He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent.",BXS
ID,"I drew him away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily.",BXS
ID,"We walked a little further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park.",BXS
ID,"It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.",BXS
ID,"After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder.",BXS
ID,"I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him.",BXS
ID,"In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--  ""Why, Mina, have I been asleep!",BXS
ID,"Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.",BXS
ID,"Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere"".",BXS
ID,"He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of.",BXS
ID,I don't like this lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain.,BXS
ID,"I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad.",BXS
ID,"The time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written.",BXS
ID,"Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.",BXS
ID,"A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be:--  ""You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.",BXS
ID,"They were both buried to-day"".",BXS
ID,"Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words!",BXS
ID,Poor Mrs. Westenra!,BXS
ID,poor Lucy!,BXS
ID,"Gone, gone, never to return to us!",BXS
ID,"And poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such sweetness out of his life!",BXS
ID,God help us all to bear our troubles.,BXS
ID,It is all over.,BXS
ID,"Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him.",BXS
ID,What a fine fellow is Quincey!,BXS
ID,I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking.,BXS
ID,"If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world indeed.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey.",BXS
ID,"He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally.",BXS
ID,"He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him some time.",BXS
ID,Poor old fellow!,BXS
ID,I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength.,BXS
ID,"All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself.",BXS
ID,"When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns.",BXS
ID,Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God.,BXS
ID,"None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall.",BXS
ID,"Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here.",BXS
ID,The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics.,BXS
ID,"He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions.",BXS
ID,"He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman does.",BXS
ID,"I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect.",BXS
ID,Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness!,BXS
ID,"Then when his face grew grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.",BXS
ID,"His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and forceful and mysterious.",BXS
ID,"He said:--  ""Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John.",BXS
ID,"Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh.",BXS
ID,"See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me.",BXS
ID,"But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come just the same.",BXS
ID,"Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, 'May I come in?",BXS
ID,' is not the true laughter.,BXS
ID,No!,BXS
ID,"he is a king, and he come when and how he like.",BXS
ID,He ask no person; he choose no time of suitability.,BXS
ID,"He say, 'I am here.",BXS
ID,"' Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want that so she may have all.",BXS
ID,And yet I can laugh at her very grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say 'Thud!,BXS
ID,thud!,BXS
ID,"' to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek.",BXS
ID,"My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same.",BXS
ID,"There, you know now why I love him so.",BXS
ID,"And yet when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear, 'Here I am!",BXS
ID,here I am!,BXS
ID,' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek.,BXS
ID,"Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play.",BXS
ID,"Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him.",BXS
ID,"And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind.",BXS
ID,"Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways.",BXS
ID,"Then tears come; and, like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break.",BXS
ID,"But King Laugh he come like the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be"".",BXS
ID,"I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him.",BXS
ID,"As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:--  ""Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!",BXS
ID,toll!,BXS
ID,toll!,BXS
ID,"' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head.",BXS
ID,And all for what?,BXS
ID,She is dead; so!,BXS
ID,"Is it not""?",BXS
ID,"""Well, for the life of me, Professor,"" I said, ""I can't see anything to laugh at in all that.",BXS
ID,"Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before.",BXS
ID,"But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and his trouble?",BXS
ID,"Why, his heart was simply breaking"".",BXS
ID,"""Just so.",BXS
ID,"Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride""?",BXS
ID,"""Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him"".",BXS
ID,"""Quite so.",BXS
ID,"But there was a difficulty, friend John.",BXS
ID,"If so that, then what about the others?",BXS
ID,"Ho, ho!",BXS
ID,"Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist"".",BXS
ID,"""I don't see where the joke comes in there either""!",BXS
ID,I said; and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things.,BXS
ID,"He laid his hand on my arm, and said:--  ""Friend John, forgive me if I pain.",BXS
ID,"I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.",BXS
ID,"If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh; if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all"".",BXS
ID,"I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.",BXS
ID,"""Because I know""!",BXS
ID,And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings.,BXS
ID,"Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.",BXS
ID,So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin another.,BXS
ID,"If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope,   The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as ""The Kensington Horror,"" or ""The Stabbing Woman,"" or ""The Woman in Black"".",BXS
ID,During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.,BXS
ID,"In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a ""bloofer lady"".",BXS
ID,"It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning.",BXS
ID,"It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a ""bloofer lady"" had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served.",BXS
ID,This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.,BXS
ID,"A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the ""bloofer lady"" is supremely funny.",BXS
ID,"Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture.",BXS
ID,"It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the ""bloofer lady"" should be the popular ríÇle at these _al fresco_ performances.",BXS
ID,Our correspondent naí¿vely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine themselves--to be.,BXS
ID,"There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat.",BXS
ID,"The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own.",BXS
ID,"The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be about.",BXS
ID,"We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts.",BXS
ID,It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases.,BXS
ID,"It was terribly weak, and looked quite emaciated.",BXS
ID,"It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the ""bloofer lady"".",BXS
ID,Jonathan is better after a bad night.,BXS
ID,"I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position.",BXS
ID,"I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him.",BXS
ID,"He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home.",BXS
ID,"My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it.",BXS
ID,I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terrible record of Jonathan's upset me so.,BXS
ID,Poor dear!,BXS
ID,"How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination.",BXS
ID,I wonder if there is any truth in it at all.,BXS
ID,"Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all?",BXS
ID,"I suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.",BXS
ID,And yet that man we saw yesterday!,BXS
ID,He seemed quite certain of him.,BXS
ID,Poor fellow!,BXS
ID,I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought.,BXS
ID,He believes it all himself.,BXS
ID,"I remember how on our wedding-day he said: ""Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane"".",BXS
ID,There seems to be through it all some thread of continuity.,BXS
ID,That fearful Count was coming to London.,BXS
ID,"If it should be, and he came to London, with his teeming millions.",BXS
ID,There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.,BXS
ID,I shall be prepared.,BXS
ID,I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing.,BXS
ID,Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required.,BXS
ID,"And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all.",BXS
ID,"If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.",BXS
ID,"""I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death.",BXS
ID,"By the kindness of Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important.",BXS
ID,"In them I find some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you love her.",BXS
ID,"Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me.",BXS
ID,"It is for others' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know.",BXS
ID,May it be that I see you?,BXS
ID,You can trust me.,BXS
ID,I am friend of Dr. John Seward and of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy).,BXS
ID,I must keep it private for the present from all.,BXS
ID,"I should come to Exeter to see you at once if you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when.",BXS
ID,"I implore your pardon, madam.",BXS
ID,"I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be, enlighten him not, lest it may harm.",BXS
ID,"Again your pardon, and forgive me.",BXS
ID,"I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as he attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about her.",BXS
ID,"That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan.",BXS
ID,Then I shall never know the real truth now!,BXS
ID,How silly I am.,BXS
ID,That awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour.,BXS
ID,Of course it is about Lucy.,BXS
ID,"That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill.",BXS
ID,I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards.,BXS
ID,"She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand.",BXS
ID,"I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy.",BXS
ID,"I hope, too, Dr. Van Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.",BXS
ID,I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain does.,BXS
ID,"Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage.",BXS
ID,"I do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will occur to upset him.",BXS
ID,"It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon now.",BXS
ID,I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me.,BXS
ID,"I am so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.",BXS
ID,He has come and gone.,BXS
ID,"Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it all makes my head whirl round!",BXS
ID,I feel like one in a dream.,BXS
ID,"Can it be all possible, or even a part of it?",BXS
ID,"If I had not read Jonathan's journal first, I should never have accepted even a possibility.",BXS
ID,"Poor, poor, dear Jonathan!",BXS
ID,How he must have suffered.,BXS
ID,"Please the good God, all this may not upset him again.",BXS
ID,"I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him, and that it is all true.",BXS
ID,"It may be that it is the doubt which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr. Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy.",BXS
ID,I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a noble nature.,BXS
ID,"When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end.",BXS
ID,"I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's friend on ""The Exeter News"" told him that memory was everything in such work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards.",BXS
ID,Here was a rare interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.,BXS
ID,It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came.,BXS
ID,I took my courage _íæ deux mains_ and waited.,BXS
ID,"In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and announced ""Dr. Van Helsing"".",BXS
ID,"I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight, strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck.",BXS
ID,"The poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears.",BXS
ID,"The face, clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens.",BXS
ID,"The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart; such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it, but falls naturally back and to the sides.",BXS
ID,"Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods.",BXS
ID,"He said to me:--  ""Mrs. Harker, is it not""?",BXS
ID,I bowed assent.,BXS
ID,"""That was Miss Mina Murray""?",BXS
ID,Again I assented.,BXS
ID,"""It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra.",BXS
ID,"Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come"".",BXS
ID,"""Sir,"" I said, ""you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra"".",BXS
ID,And I held out my hand.,BXS
ID,"He took it and said tenderly:--  ""Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn----"" He finished his speech with a courtly bow.",BXS
ID,"I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at once began:--  ""I have read your letters to Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,"Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask.",BXS
ID,I know that you were with her at Whitby.,BXS
ID,"She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her.",BXS
ID,"In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember"".",BXS
ID,"""I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it"".",BXS
ID,"""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?",BXS
ID,"It is not always so with young ladies"".",BXS
ID,"""No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time.",BXS
ID,"I can show it to you if you like"".",BXS
ID,"""Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour"".",BXS
ID,I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary.,BXS
ID,"He took it with a grateful bow, and said:--  ""May I read it""?",BXS
ID,"""If you wish,"" I answered as demurely as I could.",BXS
ID,"He opened it, and for an instant his face fell.",BXS
ID,Then he stood up and bowed.,BXS
ID,"""Oh, you so clever woman""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.",BXS
ID,And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?,BXS
ID,Alas!,BXS
ID,"I know not the shorthand"".",BXS
ID,"By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him.",BXS
ID,"""Forgive me,"" I said: ""I could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you"".",BXS
ID,He took it and his eyes glistened.,BXS
ID,"""You are so good,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""And may I read it now?",BXS
ID,"I may want to ask you some things when I have read"".",BXS
ID,"""By all means,"" I said, ""read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat"".",BXS
ID,"He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed.",BXS
ID,"When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement.",BXS
ID,He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.,BXS
ID,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""how can I say what I owe to you?",BXS
ID,This paper is as sunshine.,BXS
ID,It opens the gate to me.,BXS
ID,"I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time.",BXS
ID,"But that you do not, cannot, comprehend.",BXS
ID,"Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman.",BXS
ID,"Madam""--he said this very solemnly--""if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.",BXS
ID,"It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love.",BXS
ID,"There are darknesses in life, and there are lights; you are one of the lights.",BXS
ID,"You will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed in you"".",BXS
ID,"""But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me"".",BXS
ID,"""Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him!",BXS
ID,"And I have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line.",BXS
ID,"I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you!",BXS
ID,"Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels' eyes.",BXS
ID,"Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature.",BXS
ID,And your husband--tell me of him.,BXS
ID,Is he quite well?,BXS
ID,"Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty""?",BXS
ID,"I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said:--  ""He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's death"".",BXS
ID,"He interrupted:--  ""Oh, yes, I know, I know.",BXS
ID,"I have read your last two letters"".",BXS
ID,"I went on:--  ""I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock"".",BXS
ID,"""A shock, and after brain fever so soon!",BXS
ID,That was not good.,BXS
ID,"What kind of a shock was it""?",BXS
ID,"""He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever"".",BXS
ID,And here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush.,BXS
ID,"The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult.",BXS
ID,"I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again.",BXS
ID,"He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--  ""My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing years--the loneliness of my life.",BXS
ID,"Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be.",BXS
ID,"I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience.",BXS
ID,"I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy one.",BXS
ID,Now you must eat.,BXS
ID,You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.,BXS
ID,"Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good.",BXS
ID,Therefore for his sake you must eat and smile.,BXS
ID,"You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress.",BXS
ID,"I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you questions, if I may.",BXS
ID,"And then, too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet.",BXS
ID,"You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all"".",BXS
ID,"After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--  ""And now tell me all about him"".",BXS
ID,"When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go on.",BXS
ID,"But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband.",BXS
ID,"I have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half believed some very strange things"".",BXS
ID,"He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:--  ""Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh.",BXS
ID,"I have learned not to think little of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be.",BXS
ID,"I have tried to keep an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane"".",BXS
ID,"""Thank you, thank you, a thousand times!",BXS
ID,You have taken a weight off my mind.,BXS
ID,"If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read.",BXS
ID,"It is long, but I have typewritten it out.",BXS
ID,It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan's.,BXS
ID,"It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened.",BXS
ID,I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and judge.,BXS
ID,"And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell me what you think"".",BXS
ID,"""I promise,"" he said as I gave him the papers; ""I shall in the morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may"".",BXS
ID,"""Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight"".",BXS
ID,"He was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.",BXS
ID,"So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking--thinking I don't know what.",BXS
ID,"""I have read your husband's so wonderful diary.",BXS
ID,You may sleep without doubt.,BXS
ID,"Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_!",BXS
ID,I will pledge my life on it.,BXS
ID,It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no dread.,BXS
ID,"He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock.",BXS
ID,"His brain and his heart are all right; this I swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest.",BXS
ID,I shall have much to ask him of other things.,BXS
ID,"I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more than ever, and I must think.",BXS
ID,"""A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind.",BXS
ID,"And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London!",BXS
ID,I fear to think.,BXS
ID,"I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear to-night.",BXS
ID,"Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you?",BXS
ID,"You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you to Paddington by 2:35.",BXS
ID,"Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.",BXS
ID,"""Believe me,  ""Your faithful and grateful friend,  ""MINA HARKER"".",BXS
ID,"I thought never to write in this diary again, but the time has come.",BXS
ID,"When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me.",BXS
ID,She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was true.,BXS
ID,It seems to have made a new man of me.,BXS
ID,It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over.,BXS
ID,"I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful.",BXS
ID,"But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even of the Count.",BXS
ID,"He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I saw.",BXS
ID,"He has got younger, and how?",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what Mina says.",BXS
ID,"We sat late, and talked it all over.",BXS
ID,"Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over.",BXS
ID,"He was, I think, surprised to see me.",BXS
ID,"When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--  ""But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock"".",BXS
ID,"It was so funny to hear my wife called ""Madam Mina"" by this kindly, strong-faced old man.",BXS
ID,"I smiled, and said:--  ""I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already"".",BXS
ID,"""And how""?",BXS
ID,"""By your letter to Mina last night.",BXS
ID,"I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses.",BXS
ID,"Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life.",BXS
ID,"The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted myself.",BXS
ID,"Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself.",BXS
ID,"No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours"".",BXS
ID,"He seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--  ""So!",BXS
ID,You are physiognomist.,BXS
ID,I learn more here with each hour.,BXS
ID,"I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife"".",BXS
ID,"I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.",BXS
ID,"""She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth.",BXS
ID,"So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and selfish.",BXS
ID,"And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy, and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night.",BXS
ID,"You will give me your hand, will you not?",BXS
ID,"And let us be friends for all our lives"".",BXS
ID,"We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky.",BXS
ID,"""And now,"" he said, ""may I ask you for some more help?",BXS
ID,"I have a great task to do, and at the beginning it is to know.",BXS
ID,You can help me here.,BXS
ID,Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania?,BXS
ID,"Later on I may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do"".",BXS
ID,"""Look here, sir,"" I said, ""does what you have to do concern the Count""?",BXS
ID,"""It does,"" he said solemnly.",BXS
ID,"""Then I am with you heart and soul.",BXS
ID,"As you go by the 10:30 train, you will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.",BXS
ID,"You can take them with you and read them in the train"".",BXS
ID,After breakfast I saw him to the station.,BXS
ID,"When we were parting he said:--  ""Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina too"".",BXS
ID,"""We shall both come when you will,"" I said.",BXS
ID,"I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the train to start, he was turning them over.",BXS
ID,"His eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them, ""The Westminster Gazette""--I knew it by the colour--and he grew quite white.",BXS
ID,"He read something intently, groaning to himself: ""Mein Gott!",BXS
ID,Mein Gott!,BXS
ID,So soon!,BXS
ID,"so soon""!",BXS
ID,I do not think he remembered me at the moment.,BXS
ID,"Just then the whistle blew, and the train moved off.",BXS
ID,"This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand, calling out: ""Love to Madam Mina; I shall write so soon as ever I can"".",BXS
ID,Truly there is no such thing as finality.,BXS
ID,"Not a week since I said ""Finis,"" and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather going on with the same record.",BXS
ID,Until this afternoon I had no cause to think of what is done.,BXS
ID,"Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as he ever was.",BXS
ID,He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble to me.,BXS
ID,"I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well.",BXS
ID,"Quincey Morris is with him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits.",BXS
ID,"Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to them all my mind is at rest.",BXS
ID,"As for myself, I was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised.",BXS
ID,"Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the end God only knows.",BXS
ID,"I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows, too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity.",BXS
ID,"He went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night.",BXS
ID,"To-day he came back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock, and thrust last night's ""Westminster Gazette"" into my hand.",BXS
ID,"""What do you think of that""?",BXS
ID,he asked as he stood back and folded his arms.,BXS
ID,"I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at Hampstead.",BXS
ID,"It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats.",BXS
ID,"An idea struck me, and I looked up.",BXS
ID,"""Well""?",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""It is like poor Lucy's"".",BXS
ID,"""And what do you make of it""?",BXS
ID,"""Simply that there is some cause in common.",BXS
ID,"Whatever it was that injured her has injured them"".",BXS
ID,"I did not quite understand his answer:--  ""That is true indirectly, but not directly"".",BXS
ID,"""How do you mean, Professor""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"I was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but when I saw his face, it sobered me.",BXS
ID,"Never, even in the midst of our despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.",BXS
ID,"""Tell me""!",BXS
ID,I said.,BXS
ID,"""I can hazard no opinion.",BXS
ID,"I do not know what to think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture"".",BXS
ID,"""Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by events, but by me""?",BXS
ID,"""Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood"".",BXS
ID,"""And how the blood lost or waste""?",BXS
ID,I shook my head.,BXS
ID,"He stepped over and sat down beside me, and went on:--  ""You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold; but you are too prejudiced.",BXS
ID,"You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you.",BXS

ID,"Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.",BXS

ID,"I said, starting up.",BXS
ID,"""Do you mean to tell me that Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century""?",BXS
ID,"He waved his hand for silence, and went on:--  ""Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?",BXS

ID,Here I interrupted him.,BXS
ID,I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired.,BXS
ID,"I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time.",BXS
ID,"But now I was without this help, yet I wanted to follow him, so I said:--  ""Professor, let me be your pet student again.",BXS
ID,"Tell me the thesis, so that I may apply your knowledge as you go on.",BXS

ID,but alas!,BXS
ID,no.,BXS
ID,"It is worse, far, far worse"".",BXS
ID,"""In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean""?",BXS
ID,I cried.,BXS
ID,"He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--  ""They were made by Miss Lucy""!",BXS
ID,For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face.,BXS
ID,"I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad""?",BXS
ID,"He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once.",BXS

ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this.",BXS
ID,"Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing?",BXS
ID,Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life?,BXS
ID,Was it because I wished to give you pain?,BXS
ID,"Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death?",BXS
ID,"Ah no""!",BXS
ID,"""Forgive me,"" said I. He went on:--  ""My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady.",BXS
ID,But even yet I do not expect you to believe.,BXS
ID,"It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,To-night I go to prove it.,BXS
ID,"Dare you come with me""?",BXS
ID,This staggered me.,BXS
ID,"A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.",BXS
ID,"""And prove the very truth he most abhorred"".",BXS
ID,"He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--  ""The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog.",BXS
ID,"If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm.",BXS
ID,If it be true!,BXS
ID,"Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief.",BXS
ID,"Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam.",BXS
ID,"He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends.",BXS
ID,"We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn.",BXS
ID,"And then----""  ""And then""?",BXS
ID,He took a key from his pocket and held it up.,BXS
ID,"""And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies.",BXS
ID,This is the key that lock the tomb.,BXS
ID,"I had it from the coffin-man to give to Arthur"".",BXS
ID,"My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us.",BXS
ID,"I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing.",BXS
ID,We found the child awake.,BXS
ID,"It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures.",BXS
ID,There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat.,BXS
ID,"They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all.",BXS
ID,"We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London.",BXS
ID,"""Out of so many harmless ones,"" he said, ""there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species.",BXS
ID,"Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zoí_logical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire.",BXS
ID,"These things do occur, you know.",BXS
ID,"Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction.",BXS
ID,"For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them.",BXS
ID,"Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he might go away.",BXS
ID,"When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the 'bloofer lady.",BXS
ID,"'""  ""I hope,"" said Van Helsing, ""that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it.",BXS
ID,"These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal.",BXS
ID,"But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days""?",BXS
ID,"""Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed"".",BXS
ID,"Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out.",BXS
ID,"When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:--  ""There is no hurry.",BXS
ID,It is more late than I thought.,BXS
ID,"Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way"".",BXS
ID,"We dined at ""Jack Straw's Castle"" along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy.",BXS
ID,About ten o'clock we started from the inn.,BXS
ID,"It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius.",BXS
ID,"The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality.",BXS
ID,"As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round.",BXS
ID,"At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over.",BXS
ID,"With some little difficulty--for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found the Westenra tomb.",BXS
ID,"The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him.",BXS
ID,"There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion.",BXS
ID,"My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one.",BXS
ID,In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight.,BXS
ID,"Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light.",BXS
ID,"The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined.",BXS
ID,It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was not the only thing which could pass away.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing went about his work systematically.,BXS
ID,"Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy's coffin.",BXS
ID,"Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.",BXS
ID,"""What are you going to do""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""To open the coffin.",BXS
ID,"You shall yet be convinced"".",BXS
ID,"Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath.",BXS
ID,The sight was almost too much for me.,BXS
ID,It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took hold of his hand to stop him.,BXS
ID,"He only said: ""You shall see,"" and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw.",BXS
ID,"Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw.",BXS
ID,I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse.,BXS
ID,"We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door.",BXS
ID,"But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side.",BXS
ID,"Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.",BXS
ID,I drew near and looked.,BXS
ID,The coffin was empty.,BXS
ID,"It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved.",BXS
ID,"He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task.",BXS
ID,"""Are you satisfied now, friend John""?",BXS
ID,he asked.,BXS
ID,"I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:--  ""I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing"".",BXS
ID,"""And what is that, friend John""?",BXS
ID,"""That it is not there"".",BXS
ID,"""That is good logic,"" he said, ""so far as it goes.",BXS
ID,"But how do you--how can you--account for it not being there""?",BXS
ID,"""Perhaps a body-snatcher,"" I suggested.",BXS
ID,"""Some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it"".",BXS
ID,"I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest.",BXS
ID,The Professor sighed.,BXS
ID,"""Ah well""!",BXS
ID,"he said, ""we must have more proof.",BXS
ID,"Come with me"".",BXS
ID,"He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag.",BXS
ID,"We opened the door, and went out.",BXS
ID,Behind us he closed the door and locked it.,BXS
ID,"He handed me the key, saying: ""Will you keep it?",BXS
ID,"You had better be assured"".",BXS
ID,"I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it.",BXS
ID,"""A key is nothing,"" I said; ""there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind"".",BXS
ID,"He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.",BXS
ID,Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other.,BXS
ID,"I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.",BXS
ID,It was a lonely vigil.,BXS
ID,"Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two.",BXS
ID,"I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming.",BXS
ID,"I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it.",BXS
ID,"Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I stumbled over graves.",BXS
ID,"The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew.",BXS
ID,"A little way off, beyond a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb.",BXS
ID,"The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared.",BXS
ID,"I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child.",BXS
ID,"When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--  ""Are you satisfied now""?",BXS
ID,"""No,"" I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.",BXS
ID,"""Do you not see the child""?",BXS
ID,"""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",BXS
ID,"And is it wounded""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""We shall see,"" said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.",BXS
ID,"When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat.",BXS
ID,It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.,BXS
ID,"""Was I right""?",BXS
ID,I asked triumphantly.,BXS
ID,"""We were just in time,"" said the Professor thankfully.",BXS
ID,"We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it.",BXS
ID,"If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.",BXS
ID,"So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could.",BXS
ID,All fell out well.,BXS
ID,"At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro.",BXS
ID,"We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently.",BXS
ID,"By good chance we got a cab near the ""Spaniards,"" and drove to town.",BXS
ID,"I cannot sleep, so I make this entry.",BXS
ID,"But I must try to get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon.",BXS
ID,He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.,BXS
ID,It was two o'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt.,BXS
ID,"The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him.",BXS
ID,We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most.,BXS
ID,"Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work.",BXS
ID,"Besides, I felt it was all so useless.",BXS
ID,"Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty.",BXS
ID,"I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated.",BXS
ID,"He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede.",BXS
ID,"The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine streamed in.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.",BXS
ID,He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.,BXS
ID,"There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral.",BXS
ID,"She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead.",BXS
ID,"The lips were red, nay redder than before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.",BXS
ID,"""Is this a juggle""?",BXS
ID,I said to him.,BXS
ID,"""Are you convinced now""?",BXS
ID,"said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.",BXS
ID,"""See,"" he went on, ""see, they are even sharper than before.",BXS
ID,"With this and this""--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it--""the little children can be bitten.",BXS
ID,"Are you of belief now, friend John""?",BXS
ID,"Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me.",BXS
ID,"I _could_ not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--  ""She may have been placed here since last night"".",BXS
ID,"""Indeed?",BXS
ID,"That is so, and by whom""?",BXS
ID,"""I do not know.",BXS
ID,"Some one has done it"".",BXS
ID,"""And yet she has been dead one week.",BXS
ID,"Most peoples in that time would not look so"".",BXS
ID,"I had no answer for this, so was silent.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph.",BXS
ID,"He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth.",BXS
ID,"Then he turned to me and said:--  ""Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is some dual life that is not as the common.",BXS
ID,"She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could he best come to take more blood.",BXS
ID,"In trance she died, and in trance she is Un-Dead, too.",BXS
ID,So it is that she differ from all other.,BXS
ID,"Usually when the Un-Dead sleep at home""--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was ""home""--""their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead.",BXS
ID,"There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep"".",BXS
ID,"This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her?",BXS
ID,"He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously:--  ""Ah, you believe now""?",BXS
ID,"I answered: ""Do not press me too hard all at once.",BXS
ID,I am willing to accept.,BXS
ID,"How will you do this bloody work""?",BXS
ID,"""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body"".",BXS
ID,It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved.,BXS
ID,And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected.,BXS
ID,"I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it.",BXS
ID,"Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective?",BXS
ID,"I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought.",BXS
ID,"Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said:--  ""I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best.",BXS
ID,"If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know.",BXS
ID,This is simple.,BXS
ID,"She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever.",BXS
ID,"But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this?",BXS
ID,"If you, who saw the wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe?",BXS
ID,He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying.,BXS
ID,I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have killed her.,BXS
ID,"He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always.",BXS
ID,Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all.,BXS
ID,"And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an Un-Dead.",BXS
ID,No!,BXS
ID,"I told him once, and since then I learn much.",BXS
ID,"Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet.",BXS
ID,"He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace.",BXS
ID,My mind is made up.,BXS
ID,Let us go.,BXS
ID,"You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see that all be well.",BXS
ID,"As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way.",BXS
ID,To-morrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock.,BXS
ID,"I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood.",BXS
ID,Later we shall all have work to do.,BXS
ID,"I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set"".",BXS
ID,"So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.",BXS
ID,"_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward, M. D._  (Not delivered.",BXS
ID,")  ""_27 September.",BXS
ID,"_  ""Friend John,--  ""I write this in case anything should happen.",BXS
ID,I go alone to watch in that churchyard.,BXS
ID,"It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.",BXS
ID,Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb.,BXS
ID,"She is young as Un-Dead, and will heed.",BXS
ID,"Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be.",BXS
ID,"I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.",BXS
ID,"For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.",BXS
ID,"He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong.",BXS
ID,He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him.,BXS
ID,"Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what.",BXS
ID,So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me; but none other shall--until it be too late.,BXS
ID,But it may be that he will not attempt the place.,BXS
ID,"There is no reason why he should; his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.",BXS
ID,"""Therefore I write this in case.",BXS
ID,"Take the papers that are with this, the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it, so that the world may rest from him.",BXS
ID,"""If it be so, farewell.",BXS
ID,"""VAN HELSING"".",BXS
ID,It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for one.,BXS
ID,Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense.,BXS
ID,I have no doubt that he believes it all.,BXS
ID,I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged.,BXS
ID,Surely there must be _some_ rational explanation of all these mysterious things.,BXS
ID,Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself?,BXS
ID,He is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way.,BXS
ID,"I am loath to think it, and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully.",BXS
ID,I may get some light on the mystery.,BXS
ID,"Last night, at a little before ten o'clock, Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his.",BXS
ID,"He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, ""for,"" he said, ""there is a grave duty to be done there.",BXS
ID,"You were doubtless surprised at my letter""?",BXS
ID,This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming.,BXS
ID,"""I was.",BXS
ID,It rather upset me for a bit.,BXS
ID,There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more.,BXS
ID,"I have been curious, too, as to what you mean.",BXS
ID,"Quincey and I talked it over; but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything"".",BXS
ID,"""Me too,"" said Quincey Morris laconically.",BXS
ID,"""Oh,"" said the Professor, ""then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin"".",BXS
ID,It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word.,BXS
ID,"Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity:--  ""I want your permission to do what I think good this night.",BXS
ID,"It is, I know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much.",BXS
ID,"Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything"".",BXS
ID,"""That's frank anyhow,"" broke in Quincey.",BXS
ID,"""I'll answer for the Professor.",BXS
ID,"I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good enough for me"".",BXS
ID,"""I thank you, sir,"" said Van Helsing proudly.",BXS
ID,"""I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me"".",BXS
ID,"He held out a hand, which Quincey took.",BXS
ID,"Then Arthur spoke out:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.",BXS
ID,"If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at"".",BXS
ID,"""I accept your limitation,"" said Van Helsing, ""and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations"".",BXS
ID,"""Agreed""!",BXS
ID,"said Arthur; ""that is only fair.",BXS
ID,"And now that the _pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do""?",BXS
ID,"""I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--  ""Where poor Lucy is buried""?",BXS
ID,The Professor bowed.,BXS
ID,"Arthur went on: ""And when there""?",BXS
ID,"""To enter the tomb""!",BXS
ID,Arthur stood up.,BXS
ID,"""Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke?",BXS
ID,"Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest"".",BXS
ID,"He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.",BXS
ID,"There was silence until he asked again:--  ""And when in the tomb""?",BXS
ID,"""To open the coffin"".",BXS
ID,"""This is too much""!",BXS
ID,"he said, angrily rising again.",BXS
ID,"""I am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration of the grave--of one who----"" He fairly choked with indignation.",BXS
ID,The Professor looked pityingly at him.,BXS
ID,"""If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,"" he said, ""God knows I would.",BXS
ID,"But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame""!",BXS
ID,"Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--  ""Take care, sir, take care""!",BXS
ID,"""Would it not be well to hear what I have to say""?",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose.",BXS
ID,"Shall I go on""?",BXS
ID,"""That's fair enough,"" broke in Morris.",BXS
ID,"After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--  ""Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so?",BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,Then there can be no wrong to her.,BXS
ID,"But if she be not dead----""  Arthur jumped to his feet.",BXS
ID,"""Good God""!",BXS
ID,he cried.,BXS
ID,"""What do you mean?",BXS
ID,"Has there been any mistake; has she been buried alive""?",BXS
ID,He groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften.,BXS
ID,"""I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it.",BXS
ID,"I go no further than to say that she might be Un-Dead"".",BXS
ID,"""Un-Dead!",BXS
ID,Not alive!,BXS
ID,What do you mean?,BXS
ID,"Is this all a nightmare, or what is it""?",BXS
ID,"""There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part.",BXS
ID,"Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.",BXS
ID,But I have not done.,BXS
ID,"May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy""?",BXS
ID,"""Heavens and earth, no""!",BXS
ID,cried Arthur in a storm of passion.,BXS
ID,"""Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing, you try me too far.",BXS
ID,What have I done to you that you should torture me so?,BXS
ID,"What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave?",BXS
ID,"Are you mad that speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them?",BXS
ID,Don't dare to think more of such a desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do.,BXS
ID,"I have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do it""!",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:--  ""My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it!",BXS
ID,"All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me.",BXS
ID,"And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will"".",BXS
ID,"His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity:--  ""But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.",BXS
ID,"In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now.",BXS
ID,"Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow.",BXS
ID,Just think.,BXS
ID,For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow?,BXS
ID,"I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love.",BXS
ID,"For her--I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend.",BXS
ID,"I gave to her my nights and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely"".",BXS
ID,"He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it.",BXS
ID,"He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--  ""Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait"".",BXS
ID,It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall.,BXS
ID,The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky.,BXS
ID,"We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way.",BXS
ID,"When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well.",BXS
ID,I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief.,BXS
ID,"The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself.",BXS
ID,"The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.",BXS
ID,He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin.,BXS
ID,"Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--  ""You were with me here yesterday.",BXS
ID,"Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin""?",BXS
ID,"""It was"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor turned to the rest saying:--  ""You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me"".",BXS
ID,He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin.,BXS
ID,"Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward.",BXS
ID,"He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it.",BXS
ID,"When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.",BXS
ID,The coffin was empty!,BXS
ID,For several minutes no one spoke a word.,BXS
ID,"The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:--  ""Professor, I answered for you.",BXS
ID,Your word is all I want.,BXS
ID,I wouldn't ask such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.,BXS
ID,"Is this your doing""?",BXS
ID,"""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her.",BXS
ID,"What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here--with good purpose, believe me.",BXS
ID,"I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty.",BXS
ID,"We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees.",BXS
ID,"The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there.",BXS
ID,"Did she not, friend John""?",BXS
ID,"""Yes"".",BXS
ID,"""That night we were just in time.",BXS
ID,"One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves.",BXS
ID,"Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move.",BXS
ID,"I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing.",BXS
ID,"It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun.",BXS
ID,"Last night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things.",BXS
ID,And so it is we find this coffin empty.,BXS
ID,But bear with me.,BXS
ID,So far there is much that is strange.,BXS
ID,"Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.",BXS
ID,"So""--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--""now to the outside"".",BXS
ID,"He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.",BXS
ID,Oh!,BXS
ID,but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault.,BXS
ID,"How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city.",BXS
ID,Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.,BXS
ID,"Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery.",BXS
ID,"I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions.",BXS
ID,"Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake.",BXS
ID,"Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew.",BXS
ID,"As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way.",BXS
ID,"First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty.",BXS
ID,He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands.,BXS
ID,"This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb.",BXS
ID,"I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing.",BXS
ID,"Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious.",BXS
ID,"He answered:--  ""I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter"".",BXS
ID,"""And is that stuff you have put there going to do it""?",BXS
ID,asked Quincey.,BXS
ID,"""Great Scott!",BXS
ID,"Is this a game""?",BXS
ID,"""It is"".",BXS
ID,"""What is that which you are using""?",BXS
ID,This time the question was by Arthur.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--  ""The Host.",BXS
ID,I brought it from Amsterdam.,BXS
ID,"I have an Indulgence"".",BXS
ID,"It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust.",BXS
ID,"In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching.",BXS
ID,"I pitied the others, especially Arthur.",BXS
ID,"I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me.",BXS
ID,"Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night.",BXS
ID,"There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen ""S-s-s-s""!",BXS
ID,"He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast.",BXS
ID,"The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.",BXS
ID,"We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child.",BXS
ID,"There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams.",BXS
ID,"We were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again.",BXS
ID,"It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held.",BXS
ID,"My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra.",BXS
ID,"Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed.",BXS
ID,"The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.",BXS
ID,We shuddered with horror.,BXS
ID,I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed.,BXS
ID,"Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.",BXS
ID,"When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us.",BXS
ID,"Lucy's eyes in form and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew.",BXS
ID,"At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight.",BXS
ID,"As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile.",BXS
ID,"Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it!",BXS
ID,"With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone.",BXS
ID,"The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning.",BXS
ID,There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands.,BXS
ID,"She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:--  ""Come to me, Arthur.",BXS
ID,Leave these others and come to me.,BXS
ID,My arms are hungry for you.,BXS
ID,"Come, and we can rest together.",BXS
ID,"Come, my husband, come""!",BXS
ID,There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another.,BXS
ID,"As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.",BXS
ID,"She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix.",BXS
ID,"She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.",BXS
ID,"When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force.",BXS
ID,"Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves.",BXS
ID,"Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes.",BXS
ID,"The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese.",BXS
ID,If ever a face meant death--if looks could kill--we saw it at that moment.,BXS
ID,"And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--  ""Answer me, oh my friend!",BXS
ID,"Am I to proceed in my work""?",BXS
ID,"Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:--  ""Do as you will, friend; do as you will.",BXS
ID,"There can be no horror like this ever any more;"" and he groaned in spirit.",BXS
ID,"Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms.",BXS
ID,"We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there.",BXS
ID,"We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade could have gone.",BXS
ID,We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door.,BXS
ID,"When this was done, he lifted the child and said:  ""Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow.",BXS
ID,"There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that.",BXS
ID,"The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain.",BXS
ID,Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night.,BXS
ID,"As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow night he shall be well.",BXS
ID,"We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then to home"".",BXS
ID,"Coming close to Arthur, he said:--  ""My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary.",BXS
ID,"You are now in the bitter waters, my child.",BXS
ID,"By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch.",BXS
ID,"Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way.",BXS
ID,"We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.",BXS
ID,"A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor.",BXS
ID,It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes.,BXS
ID,"Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct.",BXS
ID,"We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.",BXS
ID,"When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb.",BXS
ID,"He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us.",BXS
ID,"Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by.",BXS
ID,When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its death-beauty.,BXS
ID,"But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her soul.",BXS
ID,I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked.,BXS
ID,"Presently he said to Van Helsing:--  ""Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape""?",BXS
ID,"""It is her body, and yet not it.",BXS
ID,"But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is"".",BXS
ID,"She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use.",BXS
ID,"First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long.",BXS
ID,"One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point.",BXS
ID,"With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps.",BXS
ID,"To me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation.",BXS
ID,"They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.",BXS
ID,"When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--  ""Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead.",BXS
ID,"When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind.",BXS
ID,"And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water.",BXS
ID,"Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.",BXS
ID,The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.,BXS
ID,"Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth.",BXS
ID,"But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been.",BXS
ID,"But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free.",BXS
ID,"Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels.",BXS
ID,"So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.",BXS
ID,To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better right?,BXS
ID,"Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?",BXS
ID,"' Tell me if there be such a one amongst us""?",BXS
ID,We all looked at Arthur.,BXS
ID,"He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:--  ""My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you.",BXS
ID,"Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter""!",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:--  ""Brave lad!",BXS
ID,"A moment's courage, and it is done.",BXS
ID,This stake must be driven through her.,BXS
ID,"It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air.",BXS
ID,But you must not falter when once you have begun.,BXS
ID,"Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time"".",BXS
ID,"""Go on,"" said Arthur hoarsely.",BXS
ID,"""Tell me what I am to do"".",BXS
ID,"""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right.",BXS
ID,"Then when we begin our prayer for the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the Un-Dead pass away"".",BXS
ID,"Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could.",BXS
ID,"Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh.",BXS
ID,Then he struck with all his might.,BXS
ID,"The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips.",BXS
ID,"The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam.",BXS
ID,But Arthur never faltered.,BXS
ID,"He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.",BXS
ID,"His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault.",BXS
ID,"And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver.",BXS
ID,Finally it lay still.,BXS
ID,The terrible task was over.,BXS
ID,The hammer fell from Arthur's hand.,BXS
ID,He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him.,BXS
ID,"The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.",BXS
ID,It had indeed been an awful strain on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it.,BXS
ID,For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin.,BXS
ID,"When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us.",BXS
ID,"We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it.",BXS
ID,"There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity.",BXS
ID,"True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew.",BXS
ID,One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to him:--  ""And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven""?",BXS
ID,"The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--  ""Forgiven!",BXS
ID,"God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace"".",BXS
ID,"He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving.",BXS
ID,"When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--  ""And now, my child, you may kiss her.",BXS
ID,"Kiss her dead lips if you will, as she would have you to, if for her to choose.",BXS
ID,For she is not a grinning devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity.,BXS
ID,No longer she is the devil's Un-Dead.,BXS
ID,"She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him""!",BXS
ID,"Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point of it in the body.",BXS
ID,Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic.,BXS
ID,"We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and gathering up our belongings, came away.",BXS
ID,When the Professor locked the door he gave the key to Arthur.,BXS
ID,"Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch.",BXS
ID,"There was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.",BXS
ID,"Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--  ""Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves.",BXS
ID,But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out.,BXS
ID,"I have clues which we can follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain.",BXS
ID,Shall you not all help me?,BXS
ID,"We have learned to believe, all of us--is it not so?",BXS
ID,"And since so, do we not see our duty?",BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end""?",BXS
ID,"Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made.",BXS
ID,"Then said the Professor as we moved off:--  ""Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend John.",BXS
ID,"I shall entreat two others, two that you know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold.",BXS
ID,"Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult about, and you can help me.",BXS
ID,"To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall return to-morrow night.",BXS
ID,And then begins our great quest.,BXS
ID,"But first I shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.",BXS
ID,"Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back"".",BXS
ID,"When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram waiting for him:--       ""Am coming up by train.",BXS
ID,Jonathan at Whitby.,BXS
ID,Important news.,BXS
ID,"--MINA      HARKER"".",BXS
ID,The Professor was delighted.,BXS
ID,"""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina,"" he said, ""pearl among women!",BXS
ID,"She arrive, but I cannot stay.",BXS
ID,"She must go to your house, friend John.",BXS
ID,You must meet her at the station.,BXS
ID,"Telegraph her _en route_, so that she may be prepared"".",BXS
ID,"When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby.",BXS
ID,"""Take these,"" he said, ""and study them well.",BXS
ID,"When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition.",BXS
ID,"Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure.",BXS
ID,"You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day.",BXS
ID,"What is here told,"" he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, ""may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the earth.",BXS
ID,"Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important.",BXS
ID,You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so?,BXS
ID,Yes!,BXS
ID,"Then we shall go through all these together when we meet"".",BXS
ID,"He then made ready for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street.",BXS
ID,"I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in.",BXS
ID,"The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick glance, said: ""Dr. Seward, is it not""?",BXS
ID,"""And you are Mrs. Harker""!",BXS
ID,I answered at once; whereupon she held out her hand.,BXS
ID,"""I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----"" She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.",BXS
ID,"The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own.",BXS
ID,"I got her luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.",BXS
ID,In due time we arrived.,BXS
ID,"She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered.",BXS
ID,"She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say.",BXS
ID,So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her.,BXS
ID,"As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me.",BXS
ID,"I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an opportunity of reading them.",BXS
ID,"She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in hand.",BXS
ID,I must be careful not to frighten her.,BXS
ID,Here she is!,BXS
ID,"After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's study.",BXS
ID,"At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one.",BXS
ID,"As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at the door, and on his calling out, ""Come in,"" I entered.",BXS
ID,"To my intense surprise, there was no one with him.",BXS
ID,"He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph.",BXS
ID,"I had never seen one, and was much interested.",BXS
ID,"""I hope I did not keep you waiting,"" I said; ""but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you"".",BXS
ID,"""Oh,"" he replied with a smile, ""I was only entering my diary"".",BXS
ID,"""Your diary""?",BXS
ID,I asked him in surprise.,BXS
ID,"""Yes,"" he answered.",BXS
ID,"""I keep it in this"".",BXS
ID,As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph.,BXS
ID,"I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--  ""Why, this beats even shorthand!",BXS
ID,"May I hear it say something""?",BXS
ID,"""Certainly,"" he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking.",BXS
ID,"Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.",BXS
ID,"""The fact is,"" he began awkwardly, ""I only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that is, I mean----"" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his embarrassment:--  ""You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end.",BXS
ID,"Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful.",BXS
ID,"She was very, very dear to me"".",BXS
ID,"To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--  ""Tell you of her death?",BXS
ID,"Not for the wide world""!",BXS
ID,"""Why not""?",BXS
ID,"I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.",BXS
ID,"Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.",BXS
ID,"At length he stammered out:--  ""You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary"".",BXS
ID,"Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naí¿vetí© of a child: ""That's quite true, upon my honour.",BXS
ID,"Honest Indian""!",BXS
ID,"I could not but smile, at which he grimaced.",BXS
ID,"""I gave myself away that time""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up""?",BXS
ID,"By this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and I said boldly:--  ""Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter"".",BXS
ID,"He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--  ""No!",BXS
ID,no!,BXS
ID,no!,BXS
ID,"For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible story""!",BXS
ID,Then it was terrible; my intuition was right!,BXS
ID,"For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table.",BXS
ID,"His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking, followed their direction.",BXS
ID,As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.,BXS
ID,"""You do not know me,"" I said.",BXS
ID,"""When you have read those papers--my own diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me better.",BXS
ID,"I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far"".",BXS
ID,He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about him.,BXS
ID,"He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and said:--  ""You are quite right.",BXS
ID,I did not trust you because I did not know you.,BXS
ID,But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long ago.,BXS
ID,I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too.,BXS
ID,May I make the only atonement in my power?,BXS
ID,"Take the cylinders and hear them--the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify you; then you will know me better.",BXS
ID,Dinner will by then be ready.,BXS
ID,"In the meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things"".",BXS
ID,He carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me.,BXS
ID,"Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already.",BXS
ID,I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without thinking.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so I said: ""She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,"" and I went on with my work.",BXS
ID,"I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when she came in.",BXS
ID,"She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying.",BXS
ID,This somehow moved me much.,BXS
ID,"Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows!",BXS
ID,"but the relief of them was denied me; and now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart.",BXS
ID,"So I said as gently as I could:--  ""I greatly fear I have distressed you"".",BXS
ID,"""Oh, no, not distressed me,"" she replied, ""but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief.",BXS
ID,"That is a wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true.",BXS
ID,"It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.",BXS
ID,It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God.,BXS
ID,No one must hear them spoken ever again!,BXS
ID,"See, I have tried to be useful.",BXS
ID,"I have copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did"".",BXS
ID,"""No one need ever know, shall ever know,"" I said in a low voice.",BXS
ID,"She laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--  ""Ah, but they must""!",BXS
ID,"""Must!",BXS
ID,"But why""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get.",BXS
ID,I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery.,BXS
ID,"You will let me help, will you not?",BXS
ID,"I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out.",BXS
ID,Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us.,BXS
ID,"He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us.",BXS
ID,"We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark"".",BXS
ID,"She looked at me so appealingly, and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes.",BXS
ID,"""You shall,"" I said, ""do as you like in the matter.",BXS
ID,God forgive me if I do wrong!,BXS
ID,"There are terrible things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the dark.",BXS
ID,"Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace.",BXS
ID,"Come, there is dinner.",BXS
ID,We must keep one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task.,BXS
ID,"When you have eaten you shall learn the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were present"".",BXS
ID,After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study.,BXS
ID,"He brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter.",BXS
ID,"He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause.",BXS
ID,"Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read.",BXS
ID,I put the forked metal to my ears and listened.,BXS
ID,"When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair powerless.",BXS
ID,Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition.,BXS
ID,"When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored me.",BXS
ID,"My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without making a scene.",BXS
ID,"It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have believed.",BXS
ID,"As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else.",BXS
ID,"I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--  ""Let me write this all out now.",BXS
ID,We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes.,BXS
ID,I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby.,BXS
ID,"In this matter dates are everything, and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much.",BXS
ID,You tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too.,BXS
ID,"Let us be able to tell him when they come"".",BXS
ID,"He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder.",BXS
ID,"I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest.",BXS
ID,"It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked.",BXS
ID,How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it.,BXS
ID,"Before I left him I remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of ""The Westminster Gazette"" and ""The Pall Mall Gazette,"" and took them to my room.",BXS
ID,"I remember how much ""The Dailygraph"" and ""The Whitby Gazette,"" of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light.",BXS
ID,"I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.",BXS
ID,Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock.,BXS
ID,He had got his wife's wire just before starting.,BXS
ID,"He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy.",BXS
ID,"If this journal be true--and judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man of great nerve.",BXS
ID,That going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring.,BXS
ID,"After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.",BXS
ID,"After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter.",BXS
ID,They are hard at it.,BXS
ID,Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have.,BXS
ID,Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them.,BXS
ID,He is now reading his wife's typescript of my diary.,BXS
ID,I wonder what they make out of it.,BXS
ID,Here it is.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be      the Count's hiding-place!,BXS
ID,Goodness knows that we had enough clues      from the conduct of the patient Renfield!,BXS
ID,The bundle of letters      relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript.,BXS
ID,"Oh,      if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!",BXS
ID,Stop; that way madness lies!,BXS
ID,"Harker has gone back, and is again      collating his material.",BXS
ID,He says that by dinner-time they will be      able to show a whole connected narrative.,BXS
ID,"He thinks that in the      meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of      index to the coming and going of the Count.",BXS
ID,"I hardly see this yet,      but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall.",BXS
ID,What a good thing      that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type!,BXS
ID,We never could have      found the dates otherwise.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,"I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands      folded, smiling benignly.",BXS
ID,At the moment he seemed as sane as any      one I ever saw.,BXS
ID,"I sat down and talked with him on a lot of      subjects, all of which he treated naturally.",BXS
ID,"He then, of his own      accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my      knowledge during his sojourn here.",BXS
ID,"In fact, he spoke quite      confidently of getting his discharge at once.",BXS
ID,"I believe that, had I      not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of      his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a      brief time of observation.",BXS
ID,"As it is, I am darkly suspicious.",BXS
ID,All      those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the      Count.,BXS
ID,What then does this absolute content mean?,BXS
ID,Can it be that      his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?,BXS
ID,"Stay; he is himself zoí_phagous, and in his wild ravings outside the      chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of ""master"".",BXS
ID,This      all seems confirmation of our idea.,BXS
ID,"However, after a while I came      away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it      safe to probe him too deep with questions.",BXS
ID,"He might begin to think,      and then--!",BXS
ID,So I came away.,BXS
ID,"I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so      I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to      have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.",BXS
ID,"When I received Mr. Billington's courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted.",BXS
ID,It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count's to its place in London.,BXS
ID,"Later, we may be able to deal with it.",BXS
ID,"Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must stay the night.",BXS
ID,"They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes.",BXS
ID,"They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.",BXS
ID,It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.,BXS
ID,"Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision.",BXS
ID,He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out.,BXS
ID,"To use an Americanism, he had ""taken no chances,"" and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of his care.",BXS
ID,"I saw the invoice, and took note of it: ""Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes"".",BXS
ID,"Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got copies.",BXS
ID,"This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master.",BXS
ID,"They had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description ""Fifty cases of common earth"".",BXS
ID,"I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes.",BXS
ID,"Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were ""main and mortal heavy,"" and that shifting them was dry work.",BXS
ID,"One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any gentleman ""such-like as yourself, squire,"" to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it.",BXS
ID,"Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach.",BXS
ID,"The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes.",BXS
ID,"He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice.",BXS
ID,"The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.",BXS
ID,"From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy.",BXS
ID,"They looked up the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross office for more details.",BXS
ID,"By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax.",BXS
ID,Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details.,BXS
ID,"These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators.",BXS
ID,"On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--  ""That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in.",BXS
ID,Blyme!,BXS
ID,but it ain't been touched sence a hundred years.,BXS
ID,There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones; an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it.,BXS
ID,"But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did!",BXS
ID,"Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough.",BXS
ID,"Lor', I wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark"".",BXS
ID,"Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.",BXS
ID,Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax.,BXS
ID,"There should be fifty of them there, unless any have since been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.",BXS
ID,I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them.,BXS
ID,By following up this clue we may learn a good deal.,BXS
ID,I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.,BXS
ID,"It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on Jonathan.",BXS
ID,"I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension.",BXS
ID,"The effort has, however, done him good.",BXS
ID,"He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of volcanic energy, as at present.",BXS
ID,"It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature.",BXS
ID,He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night.,BXS
ID,I feel myself quite wild with excitement.,BXS
ID,I suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the Count.,BXS
ID,That is just it: this Thing is not human--not even beast.,BXS
ID,"To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart.",BXS
ID,Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected.,BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them.",BXS
ID,"It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago.",BXS
ID,"Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite ""blowing my trumpet,"" as Mr. Morris expressed it.",BXS
ID,"Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy.",BXS
ID,"They did not quite know what to say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects.",BXS
ID,"However, I thought the matter over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date.",BXS
ID,I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear to betray any secret before the time.,BXS
ID,"So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.",BXS
ID,I gave them each a copy to read in the library.,BXS
ID,"When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--  ""Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker""?",BXS
ID,"I nodded, and he went on:--  ""I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you.",BXS
ID,I have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life.,BXS
ID,"Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--"" Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands.",BXS
ID,I could hear the tears in his voice.,BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the room.",BXS
ID,I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly.,BXS
ID,I sat down beside him and took his hand.,BXS
ID,"I hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought.",BXS
ID,There I wrong him; I _know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman.,BXS
ID,"I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:--  ""I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her.",BXS
ID,"She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble?",BXS
ID,"I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them.",BXS
ID,"If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for Lucy's sake""?",BXS
ID,In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief.,BXS
ID,It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once.,BXS
ID,"He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief.",BXS
ID,"He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks.",BXS
ID,"I felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.",BXS
ID,"With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.",BXS
ID,"We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child.",BXS
ID,I never thought at the time how strange it all was.,BXS
ID,"After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion.",BXS
ID,"He told me that for days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow.",BXS
ID,"There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely.",BXS
ID,"""I know now how I suffered,"" he said, as he dried his eyes, ""but I do not know even yet--and none other can ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day.",BXS
ID,"I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding.",BXS
ID,"You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake""?",BXS
ID,"""For dear Lucy's sake,"" I said as we clasped hands.",BXS
ID,"""Ay, and for your own sake,"" he added, ""for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day.",BXS
ID,"If ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call in vain.",BXS
ID,"God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know"".",BXS
ID,"He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--  ""I promise"".",BXS
ID,As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.,BXS
ID,He turned as he heard my footsteps.,BXS
ID,"""How is Art""?",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: ""Ah, I see you have been comforting him.",BXS
ID,Poor old fellow!,BXS
ID,he needs it.,BXS
ID,"No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him"".",BXS
ID,He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him.,BXS
ID,"I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:--  ""I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart.",BXS
ID,"Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it?",BXS
ID,"You will know, later on, why I speak"".",BXS
ID,"He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it.",BXS
ID,"It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him.",BXS
ID,"The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--  ""Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live""!",BXS
ID,Then he went into the study to his friend.,BXS
ID,"""Little girl""!",BXS
ID,"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!",BXS
ID,"I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged.",BXS
ID,"Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me.",BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_.",BXS
ID,"When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:--  ""Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour?",BXS
ID,"I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield.",BXS
ID,Do let me see him.,BXS
ID,"What you have said of him in your diary interests me so much""!",BXS
ID,"She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me.",BXS
ID,"When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: ""Why""?",BXS
ID,"""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,"" I answered.",BXS
ID,"""Oh, very well,"" he said; ""let her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place"".",BXS
ID,His method of tidying was peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him.,BXS
ID,"It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference.",BXS
ID,"When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully: ""Let the lady come in,"" and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered.",BXS
ID,"For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her.",BXS
ID,She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect.,BXS
ID,"She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.",BXS
ID,"""Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,"" said she.",BXS
ID,"""You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you"".",BXS
ID,"He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face.",BXS
ID,"This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:--  ""You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you?",BXS
ID,"You can't be, you know, for she's dead"".",BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--  ""Oh no!",BXS
ID,"I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me.",BXS
ID,"I am Mrs. Harker"".",BXS
ID,"""Then what are you doing here""?",BXS
ID,"""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward"".",BXS
ID,"""Then don't stay"".",BXS
ID,"""But why not""?",BXS
ID,"I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--  ""How did you know I wanted to marry any one""?",BXS
ID,"His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--  ""What an asinine question""!",BXS
ID,"""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield,"" said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me.",BXS
ID,"He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:--  ""You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects.",BXS
ID,"Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_"".",BXS
ID,I positively opened my eyes at this new development.,BXS
ID,"Here was my own pet lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman.",BXS
ID,I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched some chord in his memory.,BXS
ID,"If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.",BXS
ID,"We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic.",BXS
ID,"I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things.",BXS
ID,"""Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.",BXS
ID,"Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control.",BXS
ID,"I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life.",BXS
ID,At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life.,BXS
ID,"The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is the life.",BXS
ID,"' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt.",BXS
ID,"Isn't that true, doctor""?",BXS
ID,"I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before.",BXS
ID,"Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs. Harker that it was time to leave.",BXS
ID,"She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: ""Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,"" to which, to my astonishment, he replied:--  ""Good-bye, my dear.",BXS
ID,I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.,BXS
ID,"May He bless and keep you""!",BXS
ID,When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me.,BXS
ID,"Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy.,BXS
ID,"He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--  ""Ah, friend John, how goes all?",BXS
ID,Well?,BXS
ID,So!,BXS
ID,"I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be.",BXS
ID,"All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell.",BXS
ID,Madam Mina is with you?,BXS
ID,Yes.,BXS
ID,And her so fine husband?,BXS
ID,"And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too?",BXS
ID,"Good""!",BXS
ID,"As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:--  ""Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina!",BXS
ID,She has man's brain--a brain that a man should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart.,BXS
ID,"The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good combination.",BXS
ID,"Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair.",BXS
ID,It is not good that she run a risk so great.,BXS
ID,"We men are determined--nay, are we not pledged?",BXS
ID,--to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman.,BXS
ID,"Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams.",BXS
ID,"And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to think of some time, if not now.",BXS
ID,"You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone"".",BXS
ID,"I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own.",BXS
ID,"He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him.",BXS
ID,"""Oh that we had known it before""!",BXS
ID,"he said, ""for then we might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy.",BXS
ID,"However, 'the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say.",BXS
ID,"We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end"".",BXS
ID,Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway.,BXS
ID,"Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--  ""I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment"".",BXS
ID,"""Not up to this moment, Professor,"" she said impulsively, ""but up to this morning"".",BXS
ID,"""But why not up to now?",BXS
ID,We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made.,BXS
ID,"We have told our secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it"".",BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in.",BXS
ID,It is my record of to-day.,BXS
ID,"I too have seen the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except what is personal.",BXS
ID,"Must it go in""?",BXS
ID,"The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying:--  ""It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may.",BXS
ID,"It can but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more honour you--as well as more esteem and love"".",BXS
ID,She took it back with another blush and a bright smile.,BXS
ID,"And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and in order.",BXS
ID,"The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock.",BXS
ID,"The rest of us have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.",BXS
ID,"When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee.",BXS
ID,"Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room.",BXS
ID,"He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me.",BXS
ID,"Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre.",BXS
ID,"The Professor said:--  ""I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers"".",BXS
ID,"We all expressed assent, and he went on:--  ""Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal.",BXS
ID,"I shall then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.",BXS
ID,"So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.",BXS
ID,"""There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist.",BXS
ID,"Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.",BXS
ID,I admit that at the first I was sceptic.,BXS
ID,"Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.",BXS
ID,'See!,BXS
ID,see!,BXS
ID,I prove; I prove.,BXS
ID,' Alas!,BXS
ID,"Had I known at the first what now I know--nay, had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her.",BXS
ID,"But that is gone; and we must so work, that other poor souls perish not, whilst we can save.",BXS
ID,The _nosferatu_ do not die like the bee when he sting once.,BXS
ID,"He is only stronger; and being stronger, have yet more power to work evil.",BXS
ID,"This vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown.",BXS
ID,How then are we to begin our strike to destroy him?,BXS
ID,"How shall we find his where; and having found it, how can we destroy?",BXS
ID,"My friends, this is much; it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder.",BXS
ID,For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then where end we?,BXS
ID,Life is nothings; I heed him not.,BXS
ID,"But to fail here, is not mere life or death.",BXS
ID,"It is that we become as him; that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best.",BXS
ID,To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?,BXS
ID,We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man.,BXS
ID,But we are face to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink?,BXS
ID,"For me, I say, no; but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind.",BXS
ID,You others are young.,BXS
ID,Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store.,BXS
ID,"What say you""?",BXS
ID,"Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand.",BXS
ID,"I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so strong, so self-reliant, so resolute.",BXS
ID,A brave man's hand can speak for itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.,BXS
ID,"When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his; there was no need for speaking between us.",BXS
ID,"""I answer for Mina and myself,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""Count me in, Professor,"" said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.",BXS
ID,"""I am with you,"" said Lord Godalming, ""for Lucy's sake, if for no other reason"".",BXS
ID,Dr. Seward simply nodded.,BXS
ID,"The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side.",BXS
ID,"I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris.",BXS
ID,So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made.,BXS
ID,"I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back.",BXS
ID,"We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun.",BXS
ID,"It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life:--  ""Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not without strength.",BXS
ID,We have on our side power of combination--a power denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.,BXS
ID,"In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them.",BXS
ID,"We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one.",BXS
ID,These things are much.,BXS
ID,"""Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot.",BXS
ID,"In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.",BXS
ID,"""All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions.",BXS
ID,"These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay of more than either life or death.",BXS
ID,"Yet must we be satisfied; in the first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and superstition--are everything.",BXS
ID,"Does not the belief in vampires rest for others--though not, alas!",BXS
ID,for us--on them?,BXS
ID,"A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?",BXS
ID,We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes.,BXS
ID,"Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base.",BXS
ID,"For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been.",BXS
ID,"In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day.",BXS
ID,"He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar.",BXS
ID,"So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience.",BXS
ID,"The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living.",BXS
ID,"Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty.",BXS
ID,But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others.,BXS
ID,"Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!",BXS
ID,"He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe.",BXS
ID,"He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too.",BXS
ID,"He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,"He can come in mist which he create--that noble ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself.",BXS
ID,He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula.,BXS
ID,"He become so small--we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door.",BXS
ID,"He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire--solder you call it.",BXS
ID,"He can see in the dark--no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light.",BXS
ID,"Ah, but hear me through.",BXS
ID,"He can do all these things, yet he is not free.",BXS
ID,"Nay; he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.",BXS
ID,He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws--why we know not.,BXS
ID,"He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come; though afterwards he can come as he please.",BXS
ID,"His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.",BXS
ID,Only at certain times can he have limited freedom.,BXS
ID,"If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.",BXS
ID,"These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference.",BXS
ID,"Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come.",BXS
ID,"It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide.",BXS
ID,"Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect.",BXS
ID,"There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them.",BXS
ID,"The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.",BXS
ID,We have seen it with our eyes.,BXS
ID,"""Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know.",BXS
ID,But he is clever.,BXS
ID,"I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been.",BXS
ID,"He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey-land.",BXS
ID,"If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the forest.",BXS
ID,"' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us.",BXS
ID,"The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One.",BXS
ID,"They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due.",BXS
ID,"In the records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and 'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well.",BXS
ID,"There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.",BXS
ID,"For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest"".",BXS
ID,"Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room.",BXS
ID,"There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on:--  ""And now we must settle what we do.",BXS
ID,"We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign.",BXS
ID,"We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed.",BXS
ID,"It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed.",BXS
ID,"If the latter, we must trace----""  Here we were interrupted in a very startling way.",BXS
ID,"Outside the house came the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room.",BXS
ID,"I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out.",BXS
ID,The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash.,BXS
ID,"As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice without:--  ""Sorry!",BXS
ID,I fear I have alarmed you.,BXS
ID,"I shall come in and tell you about it"".",BXS
ID,"A minute later he came in and said:--  ""It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs. Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly.",BXS
ID,But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window-sill.,BXS
ID,"I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one.",BXS
ID,"You used to laugh at me for it then, Art"".",BXS
ID,"""Did you hit it""?",BXS
ID,asked Dr. Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood"".",BXS
ID,"Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement:--  ""We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.",BXS
ID,"Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.",BXS
ID,"""And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.",BXS
ID,You are too precious to us to have such risk.,BXS
ID,"When we part to-night, you no more must question.",BXS
ID,We shall tell you all in good time.,BXS
ID,"We are men and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are"".",BXS
ID,"All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--  ""As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now.",BXS
ID,"Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save another victim"".",BXS
ID,"I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether.",BXS
ID,"They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house.",BXS
ID,"Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger!",BXS
ID,"I shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.",BXS
ID,"Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.",BXS
ID,I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I was busy just at the moment.,BXS
ID,"The attendant added:--  ""He seems very importunate, sir.",BXS
ID,I have never seen him so eager.,BXS
ID,"I don't know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits"".",BXS
ID,"I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said: ""All right; I'll go now""; and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my ""patient"".",BXS
ID,"""Take me with you, friend John,"" said the Professor.",BXS
ID,"""His case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_ case.",BXS
ID,"I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed"".",BXS
ID,"""May I come also""?",BXS
ID,asked Lord Godalming.,BXS
ID,"""Me too""?",BXS
ID,said Quincey Morris.,BXS
ID,"""May I come""?",BXS
ID,said Harker.,BXS
ID,"I nodded, and we all went down the passage together.",BXS
ID,"We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.",BXS
ID,"There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane.",BXS
ID,"We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything.",BXS
ID,His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home.,BXS
ID,"This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity.",BXS
ID,"""I appeal to your friends,"" he said, ""they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case.",BXS
ID,"By the way, you have not introduced me"".",BXS
ID,"I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: ""Lord Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr. Renfield"".",BXS
ID,"He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--  ""Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more.",BXS
ID,"He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great state.",BXS
ID,"Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes.",BXS
ID,"The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable.",BXS
ID,What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing?,BXS
ID,"Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix.",BXS
ID,"When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class.",BXS
ID,"You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.",BXS
ID,"And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances"".",BXS
ID,He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm.,BXS
ID,I think we were all staggered.,BXS
ID,"For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning.",BXS
ID,"I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.",BXS
ID,"So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes.",BXS
ID,"This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:--  ""But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.",BXS
ID,"I desire to go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may.",BXS
ID,"Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract.",BXS
ID,"I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment"".",BXS
ID,"He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely.",BXS
ID,"Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--  ""Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition""?",BXS
ID,"""You have,"" I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.",BXS
ID,"There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--  ""Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request.",BXS
ID,"Let me ask for this concession--boon, privilege, what you will.",BXS
ID,"I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others.",BXS
ID,"I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty.",BXS
ID,"Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me.",BXS
ID,"Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends"".",BXS
ID,Again he looked at us all keenly.,BXS
ID,"I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look.",BXS
ID,"He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--  ""Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night?",BXS
ID,"I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr. Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek"".",BXS
ID,"He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face.",BXS
ID,"The Professor went on:--  ""Come, sir, bethink yourself.",BXS
ID,"You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness.",BXS
ID,"You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect.",BXS
ID,"If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us?",BXS
ID,"Be wise, and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish"".",BXS
ID,"He still shook his head as he said:--  ""Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say.",BXS
ID,"Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my own master in the matter.",BXS
ID,I can only ask you to trust me.,BXS
ID,"If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me"".",BXS
ID,"I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying:--  ""Come, my friends, we have work to do.",BXS
ID,"Good-night"".",BXS
ID,"As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.",BXS
ID,He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack.,BXS
ID,"My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner.",BXS
ID,"As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative.",BXS
ID,"I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing.",BXS
ID,"I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion.",BXS
ID,"My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition.",BXS
ID,"He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--  ""Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once.",BXS
ID,"Send me away how you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this.",BXS
ID,You don't know what you do by keeping me here.,BXS
ID,I am speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul.,BXS
ID,"You don't know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell.",BXS
ID,Woe is me!,BXS
ID,I may not tell.,BXS
ID,"By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out of this and save my soul from guilt!",BXS
ID,"Can't you hear me, man?",BXS
ID,Can't you understand?,BXS
ID,Will you never learn?,BXS
ID,"Don't you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul?",BXS
ID,"Oh, hear me!",BXS
ID,hear me!,BXS
ID,Let me go!,BXS
ID,let me go!,BXS
ID,"let me go""!",BXS
ID,"I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.",BXS
ID,"""Come,"" I said sternly, ""no more of this; we have had quite enough already.",BXS
ID,"Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly"".",BXS
ID,He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments.,BXS
ID,"Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed.",BXS
ID,"The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected.",BXS
ID,"When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, well-bred voice:--  ""You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night"".",BXS
ID,"I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well.",BXS
ID,I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.,BXS
ID,"Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us.",BXS
ID,"We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield.",BXS
ID,When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study.,BXS
ID,"Then Mr. Morris said to Dr. Seward:--  ""Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw.",BXS
ID,"I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance"".",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--  ""Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free.",BXS
ID,"But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.",BXS
ID,"All is best as they are"".",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way:--  ""I don't know but that I agree with you.",BXS
ID,If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.,BXS
ID,"I can't forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth.",BXS
ID,"Besides, he called the Count 'lord and master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.",BXS
ID,"That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic.",BXS
ID,"He certainly did seem earnest, though.",BXS
ID,I only hope we have done what is best.,BXS
ID,"These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--  ""Friend John, have no fear.",BXS
ID,We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best.,BXS
ID,"What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God""?",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned.",BXS
ID,"He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked:--  ""That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on call"".",BXS
ID,"Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out.",BXS
ID,"When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each.",BXS
ID,"Then he spoke:--  ""My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds.",BXS
ID,Our enemy is not merely spiritual.,BXS
ID,"Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not amenable to mere strength.",BXS
ID,"A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him.",BXS
ID,"We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch.",BXS
ID,"Keep this near your heart""--as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--""put these flowers round your neck""--here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms--""for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless"".",BXS
ID,"This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me.",BXS
ID,Each of the others was similarly equipped.,BXS
ID,"""Now,"" he said, ""friend John, where are the skeleton keys?",BXS
ID,"If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's"".",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead.",BXS
ID,"Presently he got one to suit; after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back.",BXS
ID,"We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened.",BXS
ID,"It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back.",BXS
ID,"The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door.",BXS
ID,"""_In manus tuas, Domine!",BXS
ID,"_"" he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold.",BXS
ID,"We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road.",BXS
ID,"The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit.",BXS
ID,Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search.,BXS
ID,"The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows.",BXS
ID,I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us.,BXS
ID,"I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania.",BXS
ID,"I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.",BXS
ID,The whole place was thick with dust.,BXS
ID,"The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked.",BXS
ID,"The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down.",BXS
ID,"On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each.",BXS
ID,"They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them.",BXS
ID,"He turned to me and said:--  ""You know this place, Jonathan.",BXS
ID,"You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do.",BXS
ID,"Which is the way to the chapel""?",BXS
ID,"I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.",BXS
ID,"""This is the spot,"" said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase.",BXS
ID,With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door.,BXS
ID,"We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered.",BXS
ID,"None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.",BXS
ID,"There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air.",BXS
ID,"But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it?",BXS
ID,"It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt.",BXS
ID,Faugh!,BXS
ID,it sickens me to think of it.,BXS
ID,Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness.,BXS
ID,"Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations.",BXS
ID,"After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.",BXS
ID,"We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began:--  ""The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest"".",BXS
ID,"A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them.",BXS
ID,There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!,BXS
ID,"Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still.",BXS
ID,"Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.",BXS
ID,"It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, ""I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows,"" and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage.",BXS
ID,"There was no sign of any one; and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_.",BXS
ID,"I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.",BXS
ID,"A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining.",BXS
ID,"We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars.",BXS
ID,We all instinctively drew back.,BXS
ID,The whole place was becoming alive with rats.,BXS
ID,"For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency.",BXS
ID,"Rushing over to the great iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open.",BXS
ID,"Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.",BXS
ID,"It was answered from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.",BXS
ID,"Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way.",BXS
ID,But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased.,BXS
ID,"They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies.",BXS
ID,"The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion.",BXS
ID,"The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor.",BXS
ID,"The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies.",BXS
ID,"They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.",BXS
ID,"With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes.",BXS
ID,We all seemed to find our spirits rise.,BXS
ID,"Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution.",BXS
ID,"We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house.",BXS
ID,"We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.",BXS
ID,"Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.",BXS
ID,The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.,BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done.",BXS
ID,"""So far,"" he said, ""our night has been eminently successful.",BXS
ID,No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing.,BXS
ID,"More than all do I rejoice that this, our first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget.",BXS
ID,"One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.",BXS
ID,"We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.",BXS
ID,So be it that he has gone elsewhere.,BXS
ID,Good!,BXS
ID,"It has given us opportunity to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls.",BXS
ID,And now let us go home.,BXS
ID,"The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night's work.",BXS
ID,"It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink"".",BXS
ID,"The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield's room.",BXS
ID,"The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.",BXS
ID,"I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.",BXS
ID,She looks paler than usual.,BXS
ID,I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her.,BXS
ID,"I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations.",BXS
ID,It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.,BXS
ID,"I did not think so at first, but I know better now.",BXS
ID,Therefore I am glad that it is settled.,BXS
ID,There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment.,BXS
ID,"Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world.",BXS
ID,"I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened.",BXS
ID,"I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.",BXS
ID,"I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all.",BXS
ID,"Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke.",BXS
ID,"Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream.",BXS
ID,"She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day.",BXS
ID,"We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all.",BXS
ID,"Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better.",BXS
ID,I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.,BXS
ID,It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room.,BXS
ID,"He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind.",BXS
ID,"After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:--  ""Your patient interests me much.",BXS
ID,May it be that with you I visit him this morning?,BXS
ID,"Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be.",BXS
ID,"It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound"".",BXS
ID,"I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions.",BXS
ID,Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient.,BXS
ID,"""But,"" he answered, ""I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things.",BXS
ID,"He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief.",BXS
ID,"Why do you smile, friend John""?",BXS
ID,"""Excuse me,"" I said, ""but the answer is here"".",BXS
ID,I laid my hand on the type-written matter.,BXS
ID,"""When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room"".",BXS
ID,Van Helsing smiled in turn.,BXS
ID,"""Good""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,"""Your memory is true, friend John.",BXS
ID,I should have remembered.,BXS
ID,And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study.,BXS
ID,Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.,BXS
ID,"Who knows""?",BXS
ID,"I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand.",BXS
ID,"It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study.",BXS
ID,"""Do I interrupt""?",BXS
ID,he asked politely as he stood at the door.,BXS
ID,"""Not at all,"" I answered.",BXS
ID,"""Come in.",BXS
ID,"My work is finished, and I am free.",BXS
ID,"I can go with you now, if you like.",BXS
ID,"""It is needless; I have seen him""!",BXS
ID,"""Well""?",BXS
ID,"""I fear that he does not appraise me at much.",BXS
ID,Our interview was short.,BXS
ID,"When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent.",BXS
ID,"I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume.",BXS
ID,He made no reply whatever.,BXS
ID,"""Don't you know me""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"His answer was not reassuring: ""I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else.,BXS
ID,"Damn all thick-headed Dutchmen""!",BXS
ID,"Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all.",BXS
ID,"Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina.",BXS
ID,"Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things.",BXS
ID,"Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so"".",BXS
ID,"""I agree with you with all my heart,"" I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter.",BXS
ID,"""Mrs. Harker is better out of it.",BXS
ID,"Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her"".",BXS
ID,So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes.,BXS
ID,I shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.,BXS
ID,"It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day; after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all.",BXS
ID,"This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier.",BXS
ID,"He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count's house.",BXS
ID,And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was.,BXS
ID,Poor dear fellow!,BXS
ID,I suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me.,BXS
ID,"They all agreed that it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and I acquiesced.",BXS
ID,But to think that he keeps anything from me!,BXS
ID,"And now I am crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.",BXS
ID,That has done me good.,BXS
ID,"Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual.",BXS
ID,"Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read.",BXS
ID,I feel strangely sad and low-spirited to-day.,BXS
ID,I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement.,BXS
ID,"Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to.",BXS
ID,"I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety.",BXS
ID,"I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end.",BXS
ID,"Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored.",BXS
ID,"If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now.",BXS
ID,"She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.",BXS
ID,"Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby?",BXS
ID,"There now, crying again!",BXS
ID,I wonder what has come over me to-day.,BXS
ID,"I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear fellow would fret his heart out.",BXS
ID,"I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it.",BXS
ID,I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn.,BXS
ID,I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night.,BXS
ID,"I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere under this.",BXS
ID,"And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.",BXS
ID,"All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own.",BXS
ID,"Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own.",BXS
ID,"I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me.",BXS
ID,"I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again.",BXS
ID,"The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows.",BXS
ID,"The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part.",BXS
ID,"Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him.",BXS
ID,"I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.",BXS
ID,"I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me.",BXS
ID,"I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me.",BXS
ID,"My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.",BXS
ID,"I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.",BXS
ID,"I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace.",BXS
ID,And so I slept uneasily and thought.,BXS
ID,"Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold.",BXS
ID,"I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around.",BXS
ID,"The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room.",BXS
ID,Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed.,BXS
ID,"I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will.",BXS
ID,I lay still and endured; that was all.,BXS
ID,"I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids.",BXS
ID,"(It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.",BXS
ID,") The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door.",BXS
ID,"It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye.",BXS
ID,"Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words ""a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night"".",BXS
ID,Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?,BXS
ID,"But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's Church.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness.",BXS
ID,The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist.,BXS
ID,"I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were too much of them.",BXS
ID,"I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them.",BXS
ID,Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me.,BXS
ID,To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally.,BXS
ID,"If I do not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep.",BXS
ID,Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.,BXS
ID,"Last night I slept, but did not dream.",BXS
ID,"I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and spiritless.",BXS
ID,"I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.",BXS
ID,In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me.,BXS
ID,"Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me.",BXS
ID,Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him.,BXS
ID,"This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful.",BXS
ID,Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying.,BXS
ID,"He and the others were out till dinner-time, and they all came in tired.",BXS
ID,"I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was.",BXS
ID,"After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's manner that he had something important to communicate.",BXS
ID,"I was not so sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before.",BXS
ID,"He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.",BXS
ID,"I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof.",BXS
ID,"I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking.",BXS
ID,I might want it.,BXS
ID,Here comes sleep.,BXS
ID,Good-night.,BXS
ID,"I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything.",BXS
ID,"The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch.",BXS
ID,"I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person.",BXS
ID,"So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer.",BXS
ID,"He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own.",BXS
ID,"He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes.",BXS
ID,"There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey.",BXS
ID,"If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully.",BXS
ID,The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London.,BXS
ID,"He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south.",BXS
ID,The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west.,BXS
ID,"I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax.",BXS
ID,"He replied:--  ""Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some""--I had given him half a sovereign--""an' I'll tell yer all I know.",BXS
ID,"I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley, as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at Purfect.",BXS
ID,"There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin' that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut"".",BXS
ID,I asked if he could tell me where to find him.,BXS
ID,I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half-sovereign to him.,BXS
ID,"So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there.",BXS
ID,"At the door he stopped, and said:--  ""Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere.",BXS
ID,"I may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night.",BXS
ID,Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.,BXS
ID,"If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night.",BXS
ID,"But ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch 'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore"".",BXS
ID,"This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change.",BXS
ID,"When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home.",BXS
ID,We're on the track anyhow.,BXS
ID,"I am tired to-night, and want sleep.",BXS
ID,"Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been crying.",BXS
ID,"Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others.",BXS
ID,But it is best as it is.,BXS
ID,It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken.,BXS
ID,The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business.,BXS
ID,"I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest.",BXS
ID,I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances.,BXS
ID,"Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.",BXS
ID,A long and trying and exciting day.,BXS
ID,"By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--  ""Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.",BXS
ID,"Arsk for the depite"".",BXS
ID,"I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.",BXS
ID,"She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well.",BXS
ID,"I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter.",BXS
ID,"I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance.",BXS
ID,"I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything.",BXS
ID,"I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter's Court.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court.",BXS
ID,"However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.",BXS
ID,"When I asked the man who came to the door for the ""depite,"" he shook his head, and said: ""I dunno 'im.",BXS
ID,There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never 'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days.,BXS
ID,"Don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin' ere or anywheres"".",BXS
ID,"I took out Smollet's letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me.",BXS
ID,"""What are you""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""I'm the depity,"" he answered.",BXS
ID,I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled me.,BXS
ID,"A half-crown tip put the deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that morning.",BXS
ID,"He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a ""new-fangled ware'us""; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar.",BXS
ID,"It was twelve o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner.",BXS
ID,"One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new ""cold storage"" building; and as this suited the condition of a ""new-fangled ware'us,"" I at once drove to it.",BXS
ID,"An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter.",BXS
ID,"He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing.",BXS
ID,"When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--""main heavy ones""--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose.",BXS
ID,"I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:--  ""Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built.",BXS
ID,"It was a dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we tooked the bloomin' boxes from"".",BXS
ID,"""How did you get into the houses if they were both empty""?",BXS
ID,"""There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet.",BXS
ID,He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray.,BXS
ID,"Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw a shadder"".",BXS
ID,How this phrase thrilled through me!,BXS
ID,"""Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no chicken, neither"".",BXS
ID,"""How did you get into the house in Piccadilly""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""He was there too.",BXS
ID,"He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me to carry the boxes into the 'all"".",BXS
ID,"""The whole nine""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second.",BXS
ID,"It was main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome"".",BXS
ID,"I interrupted him:--  ""Were the boxes left in the hall""?",BXS
ID,"""Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it"".",BXS
ID,"I made one more attempt to further matters:--  ""You didn't have any key""?",BXS
ID,"""Never used no key nor nothink.",BXS
ID,"The old gent, he opened the door 'isself an' shut it again when I druv off.",BXS
ID,"I don't remember the last time--but that was the beer"".",BXS
ID,"""And you can't remember the number of the house""?",BXS
ID,"""No, sir.",BXS

ID,"It's a 'igh 'un with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door.",BXS
ID,"I know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper.",BXS
ID,"The old gent give them shillin's, an' they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin'"".",BXS
ID,"I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly.",BXS
ID,"I had gained a new painful experience; the Count could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself.",BXS
ID,"If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved.",BXS
ID,"At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula.",BXS
ID,The house looked as though it had been long untenanted.,BXS
ID,"The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up.",BXS
ID,"All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away.",BXS
ID,"It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.",BXS
ID,"Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white.",BXS
ID,"I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house.",BXS
ID,"I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.",BXS
ID,"There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter.",BXS
ID,"The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation.",BXS
ID,I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house.,BXS
ID,"One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldn't say from whom.",BXS
ID,"He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a notice-board of ""For Sale"" up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board.",BXS
ID,"I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away.",BXS
ID,"It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time.",BXS
ID,"Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street.",BXS
ID,"The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion.",BXS
ID,"Having once told me that the Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a ""mansion""--was sold, he considered my business as concluded.",BXS
ID,"When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying:--  ""It is sold, sir"".",BXS
ID,"""Pardon me,"" I said, with equal politeness, ""but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it"".",BXS
ID,"Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more.",BXS
ID,"""It is sold, sir,"" was again his laconic reply.",BXS
ID,"""Surely,"" I said, ""you do not mind letting me know so much"".",BXS
ID,"""But I do mind,"" he answered.",BXS
ID,"""The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy"".",BXS
ID,"This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him.",BXS
ID,"I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--  ""Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence.",BXS
ID,"I am myself a professional man"".",BXS
ID,Here I handed him my card.,BXS
ID,"""In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale"".",BXS
ID,These words put a different complexion on affairs.,BXS
ID,"He said:--  ""I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship.",BXS
ID,We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood.,BXS
ID,"If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by to-night's post.",BXS
ID,"It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship"".",BXS
ID,"I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away.",BXS
ID,"It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry.",BXS
ID,I got a cup of tea at the Aí‚rated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train.,BXS
ID,I found all the others at home.,BXS
ID,"Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude.",BXS
ID,"Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence.",BXS
ID,It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task.,BXS
ID,"She seems somehow more reconciled; or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders.",BXS
ID,"I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her.",BXS
ID,I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone; so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.,BXS
ID,"The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away.",BXS
ID,"Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.",BXS
ID,When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study.,BXS
ID,"In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--  ""This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan.",BXS
ID,Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes.,BXS
ID,"If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end.",BXS
ID,"But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them.",BXS
ID,"Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the wretch to his real death"".",BXS
ID,"We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke:--  ""Say!",BXS
ID,"how are we going to get into that house""?",BXS
ID,"""We got into the other,"" answered Lord Godalming quickly.",BXS
ID,"""But, Art, this is different.",BXS
ID,"We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us.",BXS
ID,"It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night.",BXS
ID,"I confess I don't see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning"".",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room.",BXS
ID,"By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:--  ""Quincey's head is level.",BXS
ID,"This burglary business is getting serious; we got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we can find the Count's key basket"".",BXS
ID,"As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's, we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time.",BXS
ID,"For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment.",BXS
ID,I am very sleepy and shall go to bed.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,Just a line.,BXS
ID,Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.,BXS
ID,"Her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even in her sleep.",BXS
ID,"She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she did this morning.",BXS
ID,"To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be herself at home in Exeter.",BXS
ID,"Oh, but I am sleepy!",BXS
ID,I am puzzled afresh about Renfield.,BXS
ID,"His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more than interesting study.",BXS
ID,"This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.",BXS
ID,"He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively.",BXS
ID,He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals.,BXS
ID,"I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him:--  ""What about the flies these times""?",BXS
ID,"He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as he answered me:--  ""The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical of the aí‚rial powers of the psychic faculties.",BXS
ID,"The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly""!",BXS
ID,"I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly:--  ""Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it""?",BXS
ID,"His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--  ""Oh, no, oh no!",BXS
ID,I want no souls.,BXS
ID,"Life is all I want"".",BXS
ID,"Here he brightened up; ""I am pretty indifferent about it at present.",BXS
ID,Life is all right; I have all I want.,BXS
ID,"You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to study zoí_phagy""!",BXS
ID,"This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--  ""Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose""?",BXS
ID,He smiled with an ineffably benign superiority.,BXS
ID,"""Oh no!",BXS
ID,Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the Deity.,BXS
ID,I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings.,BXS
ID,"If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually""!",BXS
ID,This was a poser to me.,BXS
ID,"I could not at the moment recall Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--  ""And why with Enoch""?",BXS
ID,"""Because he walked with God"".",BXS
ID,"I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--  ""So you don't care about life and you don't want souls.",BXS
ID,"Why not""?",BXS
ID,"I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.",BXS
ID,"The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied:--  ""I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed!",BXS
ID,I don't.,BXS
ID,I couldn't use them if I had them; they would be no manner of use to me.,BXS
ID,"I couldn't eat them or----"" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water.",BXS
ID,"""And doctor, as to life, what is it after all?",BXS
ID,"When you've got all you require, and you know that you will never want, that is all.",BXS
ID,"I have friends--good friends--like you, Dr. Seward""; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning.",BXS
ID,"""I know that I shall never lack the means of life""!",BXS
ID,"I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he--a dogged silence.",BXS
ID,After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him.,BXS
ID,"He was sulky, and so I came away.",BXS
ID,Later in the day he sent for me.,BXS
ID,"Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort.",BXS
ID,"Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time.",BXS
ID,"Harker is out, following up clues; and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue.,BXS
ID,"He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause.",BXS
ID,"I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again.",BXS
ID,There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.,BXS
ID,"I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part.",BXS
ID,"When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips:--  ""What about souls""?",BXS
ID,It was evident then that my surmise had been correct.,BXS
ID,"Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic.",BXS
ID,I determined to have the matter out.,BXS
ID,"""What about them yourself""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.",BXS
ID,"""I don't want any souls""!",BXS
ID,"he said in a feeble, apologetic way.",BXS
ID,"The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to ""be cruel only to be kind"".",BXS
ID,"So I said:--  ""You like life, and you want life""?",BXS
ID,"""Oh yes!",BXS
ID,"but that is all right; you needn't worry about that""!",BXS
ID,"""But,"" I asked, ""how are we to get the life without getting the soul also""?",BXS
ID,"This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--  ""A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you.",BXS
ID,"You've got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls""!",BXS
ID,"Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped.",BXS
ID,"There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white.",BXS
ID,"It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him.",BXS
ID,"The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--  ""Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again""?",BXS
ID,"He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.",BXS
ID,"With a laugh he replied:--  ""Not much!",BXS
ID,"flies are poor things, after all""!",BXS
ID,"After a pause he added, ""But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same"".",BXS
ID,"""Or spiders""?",BXS
ID,I went on.,BXS
ID,"""Blow spiders!",BXS
ID,What's the use of spiders?,BXS
ID,"There isn't anything in them to eat or""--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic.",BXS
ID,"""So, so""!",BXS
ID,"I thought to myself, ""this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean""?",BXS
ID,"Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it:--  ""I don't take any stock at all in such matters.",BXS
ID,"'Rats and mice and such small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they might be called.",BXS
ID,I'm past all that sort of nonsense.,BXS
ID,"You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me"".",BXS
ID,"""I see,"" I said.",BXS
ID,"""You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in?",BXS
ID,"How would you like to breakfast on elephant""?",BXS
ID,"""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking""!",BXS
ID,"He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard.",BXS
ID,"""I wonder,"" I said reflectively, ""what an elephant's soul is like""!",BXS
ID,"The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.",BXS
ID,"""I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all""!",BXS
ID,he said.,BXS
ID,For a few moments he sat despondently.,BXS
ID,"Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement.",BXS
ID,"""To hell with you and your souls""!",BXS
ID,he shouted.,BXS
ID,"""Why do you plague me about souls?",BXS
ID,"Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls""!",BXS
ID,"He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.",BXS
ID,"The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--  ""Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself.",BXS
ID,You do not need any help.,BXS
ID,I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable.,BXS
ID,"If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and pardon me.",BXS
ID,Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat.,BXS
ID,I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined.,BXS
ID,"I am sure you will understand""!",BXS
ID,"He had evidently self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew.",BXS
ID,"Renfield watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness:--  ""Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me.",BXS
ID,"Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you""!",BXS
ID,"I thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away.",BXS
ID,There is certainly something to ponder over in this man's state.,BXS
ID,"Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls ""a story,"" if one could only get them in proper order.",BXS
ID,"Here they are:--  Will not mention ""drinking"".",BXS
ID,"Fears the thought of being burdened with the ""soul"" of anything.",BXS
ID,"Has no dread of wanting ""life"" in the future.",BXS
ID,"Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls.",BXS
ID,Logically all these things point one way!,BXS
ID,he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life.,BXS
ID,He dreads the consequence--the burden of a soul.,BXS
ID,Then it is a human life he looks to!,BXS
ID,And the assurance--?,BXS
ID,Merciful God!,BXS
ID,"the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!",BXS
ID,I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion.,BXS
ID,"He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield.",BXS
ID,I did so.,BXS
ID,"As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago.",BXS
ID,"When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room.",BXS
ID,"We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend.",BXS
ID,"He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present.",BXS
ID,He had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book.,BXS
ID,We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.,BXS
ID,His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.,BXS
ID,"""We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes.",BXS
ID,"We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No.",BXS
ID,"347, Piccadilly.",BXS
ID,The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield.,BXS
ID,"The purchaser is a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression.",BXS
ID,Beyond this we know nothing whatever of him.,BXS
ID,"I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me.",BXS
ID,"After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day.",BXS
ID,"Harker was the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.",BXS
ID,Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in through the observation trap.,BXS
ID,"He was sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.",BXS
ID,This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly.,BXS
ID,I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard.,BXS
ID,There was something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep.,BXS
ID,"He denied sleep, but admitted to having ""dozed"" for a while.",BXS
ID,It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.,BXS
ID,"To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses.",BXS
ID,"Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose.",BXS
ID,"We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine.,BXS
ID,"The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.",BXS
ID,I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.,BXS
ID,We have met again.,BXS
ID,"We seem at last to be on the track, and our work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end.",BXS
ID,I wonder if Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this.,BXS
ID,"His moods have so followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way.",BXS
ID,"If we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue.",BXS
ID,He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,Is he?,BXS
ID,#NAME?,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident.,BXS
ID,"He had heard him yell; and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.",BXS
ID,I must go at once.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,"Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since last I made an entry.",BXS
ID,Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.,BXS
ID,When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.,BXS
ID,"When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity.",BXS
ID,"As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated.",BXS
ID,"The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over:--  ""I think, sir, his back is broken.",BXS
ID,"See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed"".",BXS
ID,How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.,BXS
ID,"He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--  ""I can't understand the two things.",BXS
ID,He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor.,BXS
ID,I saw a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her.,BXS
ID,"And I suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink.",BXS
ID,But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things occurred.,BXS
ID,"If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of it"".",BXS
ID,"I said to him:--  ""Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once.",BXS
ID,"I want him without an instant's delay"".",BXS
ID,"The man ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared.",BXS
ID,"When he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me.",BXS
ID,"I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--  ""Ah, a sad accident!",BXS
ID,"He will need very careful watching, and much attention.",BXS
ID,I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.,BXS
ID,"If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you"".",BXS
ID,The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case.",BXS
ID,"He had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--  ""Send the attendant away.",BXS
ID,"We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation"".",BXS
ID,"So I said:--  ""I think that will do now, Simmons.",BXS
ID,We have done all that we can at present.,BXS
ID,"You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.",BXS
ID,"Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere"".",BXS
ID,"The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.",BXS
ID,"The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area.",BXS
ID,"The Professor thought a moment and said:--  ""We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury.",BXS
ID,The whole motor area seems affected.,BXS
ID,"The suffusion of the brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late"".",BXS
ID,As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.,BXS
ID,"I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--  ""I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.",BXS
ID,So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep.,BXS
ID,Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times.,BXS
ID,I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been.,BXS
ID,We'll have to look back--and forward a little more than we have done.,BXS
ID,"May we come in""?",BXS
ID,"I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered; then I closed it again.",BXS
ID,"When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the floor, he said softly:--  ""My God!",BXS
ID,what has happened to him?,BXS
ID,"Poor, poor devil""!",BXS
ID,"I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation--for a short time, at all events.",BXS
ID,"He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched in patience.",BXS
ID,"""We shall wait,"" said Van Helsing, ""just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the hí_morrhage is increasing"".",BXS
ID,The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness.,BXS
ID,"I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come.",BXS
ID,I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak.,BXS
ID,"I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the death-watch.",BXS
ID,The poor man's breathing came in uncertain gasps.,BXS
ID,"Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility.",BXS
ID,"Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me.",BXS
ID,I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer.,BXS
ID,The silence finally became agonising.,BXS
ID,"I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture.",BXS
ID,"There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.",BXS
ID,At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment.,BXS
ID,I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine.,BXS
ID,"His face was sternly set as he spoke:--  ""There is no time to lose.",BXS
ID,"His words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here.",BXS
ID,It may be there is a soul at stake!,BXS
ID,"We shall operate just above the ear"".",BXS
ID,Without another word he made the operation.,BXS
ID,For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous.,BXS
ID,Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.,BXS
ID,"Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.",BXS
ID,"This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief.",BXS
ID,"He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:--  ""I'll be quiet, Doctor.",BXS
ID,Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat.,BXS
ID,"I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move.",BXS
ID,What's wrong with my face?,BXS
ID,"it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully"".",BXS
ID,He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back.,BXS
ID,"Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--  ""Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield"".",BXS
ID,"As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--  ""That is Dr. Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,How good it is of you to be here.,BXS
ID,"Give me some water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you.",BXS
ID,"I dreamed""--he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--""The brandy--it is in my study--quick""!",BXS
ID,"He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water.",BXS
ID,"We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived.",BXS
ID,"It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said:--  ""I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality"".",BXS
ID,"Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--  ""If I were not sure already, I would know from them"".",BXS
ID,"For an instant his eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--  ""Quick, Doctor, quick.",BXS
ID,I am dying!,BXS
ID,I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to death--or worse!,BXS
ID,Wet my lips with brandy again.,BXS
ID,I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow.,BXS
ID,Thank you!,BXS
ID,"It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away.",BXS
ID,"I couldn't speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now.",BXS
ID,I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours.,BXS
ID,Then there came a sudden peace to me.,BXS
ID,"My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was.",BXS
ID,"I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was""!",BXS
ID,"As he spoke, Van Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard.",BXS
ID,"He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: ""Go on,"" in a low voice.",BXS
ID,"Renfield proceeded:--  ""He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before; but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a man's when angry.",BXS
ID,"He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking.",BXS
ID,"I wouldn't ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.",BXS
ID,"Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them"".",BXS
ID,"He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--  ""How""?",BXS
ID,"""By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining.",BXS
ID,"Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs"".",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--  ""The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the 'Death's-head Moth'""?",BXS
ID,The patient went on without stopping.,BXS
ID,"""Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats!",BXS
ID,"Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too.",BXS
ID,All lives!,BXS
ID,"all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely buzzing flies!",BXS
ID,"' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.",BXS
ID,"Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.",BXS
ID,He beckoned me to the window.,BXS
ID,"I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words.",BXS
ID,"A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only smaller.",BXS
ID,"He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!",BXS
ID,"' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!",BXS
ID,"' The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour"".",BXS
ID,"His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced.",BXS
ID,"I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: ""Let him go on.",BXS
ID,"Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought"".",BXS
ID,"He proceeded:--  ""All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.",BXS
ID,"When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him.",BXS
ID,"He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one.",BXS
ID,He didn't even smell the same as he went by me.,BXS
ID,I couldn't hold him.,BXS
ID,"I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the room"".",BXS
ID,"The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.",BXS
ID,"They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.",BXS
ID,"Renfield went on without noticing:--  ""When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been watered"".",BXS
ID,"Here we all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:--  ""I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the same.",BXS
ID,"I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out.",BXS
ID,"I didn't think of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her"".",BXS
ID,"I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still.",BXS
ID,"""So when He came to-night I was ready for Him.",BXS
ID,"I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight.",BXS
ID,I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.,BXS
ID,"Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me.",BXS
ID,"I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes.",BXS
ID,"They burned into me, and my strength became like water.",BXS
ID,"He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down.",BXS
ID,"There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door"".",BXS
ID,His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing stood up instinctively.,BXS
ID,"""We know the worst now,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""He is here, and we know his purpose.",BXS
ID,It may not be too late.,BXS
ID,"Let us be armed--the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare"".",BXS
ID,"There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in common.",BXS
ID,We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count's house.,BXS
ID,"The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--  ""They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is over.",BXS
ID,"Be wise also, my friends.",BXS
ID,It is no common enemy that we deal with.,BXS
ID,Alas!,BXS
ID,alas!,BXS
ID,"that that dear Madam Mina should suffer""!",BXS
ID,"He stopped; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.",BXS
ID,Outside the Harkers' door we paused.,BXS
ID,"Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said:--  ""Should we disturb her""?",BXS
ID,"""We must,"" said Van Helsing grimly.",BXS
ID,"""If the door be locked, I shall break it in"".",BXS
ID,"""May it not frighten her terribly?",BXS
ID,"It is unusual to break into a lady's room""!",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing said solemnly, ""You are always right; but this is life and death.",BXS
ID,All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they are all as one to me to-night.,BXS
ID,"Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends.",BXS
ID,"Now""!",BXS
ID,"He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield.",BXS
ID,"We threw ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room.",BXS
ID,"The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees.",BXS
ID,What I saw appalled me.,BXS
ID,"I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still.",BXS
ID,The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see.,BXS
ID,"On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.",BXS
ID,Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife.,BXS
ID,"By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.",BXS
ID,"His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead.",BXS
ID,"With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom.",BXS
ID,"Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress.",BXS
ID,The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink.,BXS
ID,"As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it.",BXS
ID,"His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast.",BXS
ID,"With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us.",BXS
ID,"But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer.",BXS
ID,"The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back.",BXS
ID,"Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced.",BXS
ID,"The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour.",BXS
ID,"This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day.",BXS
ID,For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray.,BXS
ID,"Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror.",BXS
ID,"Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing whispered to me:--  ""Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce.",BXS
ID,"We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him""!",BXS
ID,"He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart-breaking to hear.",BXS
ID,"I raised the blind, and looked out of the window.",BXS
ID,There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree.,BXS
ID,"It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed.",BXS
ID,"On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement.",BXS
ID,"He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up.",BXS
ID,"His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.",BXS
ID,"""In God's name what does this mean""?",BXS
ID,Harker cried out.,BXS
ID,"""Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it?",BXS
ID,What has happened?,BXS
ID,What is wrong?,BXS
ID,"Mina, dear, what is it?",BXS
ID,What does that blood mean?,BXS
ID,"My God, my God!",BXS
ID,"has it come to this""!",BXS
ID,"and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together.",BXS
ID,"""Good God help us!",BXS
ID,help her!,BXS
ID,"oh, help her""!",BXS
ID,"With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion.",BXS
ID,"""What has happened?",BXS
ID,"Tell me all about it""!",BXS
ID,he cried without pausing.,BXS
ID,"""Dr. Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know.",BXS
ID,"Oh, do something to save her.",BXS
ID,It cannot have gone too far yet.,BXS
ID,"Guard her while I look for _him_""!",BXS
ID,"His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--  ""No!",BXS
ID,no!,BXS
ID,"Jonathan, you must not leave me.",BXS
ID,"I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you.",BXS
ID,You must stay with me.,BXS
ID,"Stay with these friends who will watch over you""!",BXS
ID,"Her expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.,BXS
ID,"The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--  ""Do not fear, my dear.",BXS
ID,We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach.,BXS
ID,"You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together"".",BXS
ID,"She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husband's breast.",BXS
ID,"When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops.",BXS
ID,"The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs:--  ""Unclean, unclean!",BXS
ID,I must touch him or kiss him no more.,BXS
ID,"Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear"".",BXS
ID,"To this he spoke out resolutely:--  ""Nonsense, Mina.",BXS
ID,It is a shame to me to hear such a word.,BXS
ID,I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you.,BXS
ID,"May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us""!",BXS
ID,He put out his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing.,BXS
ID,"He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel.",BXS
ID,"After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost:--  ""And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it.",BXS
ID,"Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been"".",BXS
ID,"I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast.",BXS
ID,"It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.",BXS
ID,"Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.",BXS
ID,They entered in obedience to our summons.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing looked at me questioningly.,BXS
ID,I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done.,BXS
ID,"To which Lord Godalming answered:--  ""I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms.",BXS
ID,"I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone.",BXS
ID,"He had, however----"" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing said gravely:--  ""Go on, friend Arthur.",BXS
ID,We want here no more concealments.,BXS
ID,Our hope now is in knowing all.,BXS
ID,"Tell freely""!",BXS
ID,"So Art went on:--  ""He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place.",BXS
ID,"All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames"".",BXS
ID,Here I interrupted.,BXS
ID,"""Thank God there is the other copy in the safe""!",BXS
ID,"His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on: ""I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him.",BXS
ID,"I looked into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----""!",BXS
ID,Again he paused.,BXS
ID,"""Go on,"" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added: ""except that the poor fellow is dead"".",BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly:--  ""God's will be done""!",BXS
ID,"I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--  ""And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell""?",BXS
ID,"""A little,"" he answered.",BXS
ID,"""It may be much eventually, but at present I can't say.",BXS
ID,I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house.,BXS
ID,"I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from Renfield's window, and flap westward.",BXS
ID,I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair.,BXS
ID,"He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close.",BXS
ID,"We must work to-morrow""!",BXS
ID,He said the latter words through his shut teeth.,BXS
ID,"For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--  ""And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what happened.",BXS
ID,God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is need that we know all.,BXS
ID,"For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest.",BXS
ID,"The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and learn"".",BXS
ID,"The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast.",BXS
ID,"Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast.",BXS
ID,"The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.",BXS
ID,"After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:--  ""I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act.",BXS
ID,"I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble"".",BXS
ID,"Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: ""Do not fret, dear.",BXS
ID,"You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task.",BXS
ID,"If you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your help.",BXS
ID,"Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to sleep.",BXS
ID,"Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember.",BXS
ID,There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed.,BXS
ID,But I forget now if you know of this; you will find it in my diary which I shall show you later.,BXS
ID,I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.,BXS
ID,"I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him.",BXS
ID,"This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified.",BXS
ID,"Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a tall, thin man, all in black.",BXS
ID,I knew him at once from the description of the others.,BXS
ID,"The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby.",BXS
ID,"I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him.",BXS
ID,"For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed.",BXS
ID,"In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--  ""'Silence!",BXS
ID,If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.,BXS
ID,' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything.,BXS
ID,"With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions.",BXS
ID,"You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my thirst!",BXS
ID,"' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him.",BXS
ID,"I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim.",BXS
ID,"And oh, my God, my God, pity me!",BXS
ID,"He placed his reeking lips upon my throat""!",BXS
ID,Her husband groaned again.,BXS
ID,"She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on:--  ""I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon.",BXS
ID,"How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away.",BXS
ID,"I saw it drip with the fresh blood""!",BXS
ID,"The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband's sustaining arm.",BXS
ID,"With a great effort she recovered herself and went on:--  ""Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine.",BXS
ID,You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs!,BXS
ID,"You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path.",BXS
ID,They should have kept their energies for use closer to home.,BXS
ID,"Whilst they played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were born--I was countermining them.",BXS
ID,"And you, their best beloved one, are now to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper.",BXS
ID,You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs.,BXS
ID,But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done.,BXS
ID,You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call.,BXS
ID,"When my brain says ""Come""!",BXS
ID,"to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!",BXS
ID,"' With that he pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast.",BXS
ID,"When the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh my God!",BXS
ID,my God!,BXS
ID,what have I done?,BXS
ID,"What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days.",BXS
ID,God pity me!,BXS
ID,"Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril; and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear""!",BXS
ID,Then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.,BXS
ID,"As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more clear.",BXS
ID,"Harker was still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair.",BXS
ID,We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.,BXS
ID,Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.,BXS
ID,"As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary.",BXS
ID,"It is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best.",BXS
ID,"Our best will be, God knows, required to-day.",BXS
ID,"I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare not stop to think.",BXS
ID,"All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most.",BXS

ID,"However, we must trust and hope.",BXS

ID,"When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done.",BXS
ID,"First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap.",BXS
ID,"His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.",BXS
ID,Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything.,BXS
ID,"He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had called out loudly several times, ""God!",BXS
ID,God!,BXS
ID,"God""!",BXS
ID,"after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing asked if he had heard ""voices"" or ""a voice,"" and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one.",BXS
ID,"He could swear to it, if required, that the word ""God"" was spoken by the patient.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it.",BXS
ID,"As it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.",BXS
ID,"In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result.",BXS
ID,"When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be kept from her.",BXS
ID,"She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of despair.",BXS
ID,"""There must be no concealment,"" she said, ""Alas!",BXS
ID,we have had too much already.,BXS
ID,And besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!,BXS
ID,"Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me""!",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:--  ""But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has happened""?",BXS
ID,"Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered:--  ""Ah no!",BXS
ID,"for my mind is made up""!",BXS
ID,"""To what""?",BXS
ID,"he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant.",BXS
ID,"Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--  ""Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of harm to any that I love, I shall die""!",BXS
ID,"""You would not kill yourself""?",BXS
ID,"he asked, hoarsely.",BXS
ID,"""I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a pain, and so desperate an effort""!",BXS
ID,She looked at him meaningly as she spoke.,BXS
ID,"He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:  ""My child, there is such an one if it were for your good.",BXS
ID,"For myself I could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you, even at this moment if it were best.",BXS
ID,"Nay, were it safe!",BXS
ID,"But my child----"" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his throat; he gulped it down and went on:--  ""There are here some who would stand between you and death.",BXS
ID,You must not die.,BXS
ID,You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own.,BXS
ID,"Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make you even as he is.",BXS
ID,"No, you must live!",BXS
ID,"You must struggle and strive to live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable.",BXS
ID,"You must fight Death himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the night; in safety or in peril!",BXS
ID,"On your living soul I charge you that you do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past"".",BXS
ID,"The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide.",BXS
ID,We were all silent; we could do nothing.,BXS
ID,"At length she grew more calm and turning to him said, sweetly, but oh!",BXS
ID,"so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--  ""I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may have passed away from me"".",BXS
ID,"She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do.",BXS
ID,"I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.",BXS
ID,"She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if ""pleased"" could be used in connection with so grim an interest.",BXS
ID,"As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work.",BXS
ID,"""It is perhaps well,"" he said, ""that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay there.",BXS
ID,"Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our intentions.",BXS
ID,"Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old.",BXS
ID,"We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them.",BXS
ID,"To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope.",BXS
ID,The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course.,BXS
ID,"Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has.",BXS
ID,He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope.,BXS
ID,He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies.,BXS
ID,"If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal.",BXS
ID,And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them.,BXS
ID,"So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure"".",BXS
ID,"Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible.",BXS
ID,But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly.,BXS
ID,"""Nay, friend Jonathan,"" he said, ""in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say.",BXS
ID,"We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come.",BXS
ID,"But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.",BXS
ID,The Count may have many houses which he has bought.,BXS
ID,"Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things.",BXS
ID,He will have paper that he write on; he will have his book of cheques.,BXS
ID,"There are many belongings that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice.",BXS
ID,"We shall go there and search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we run down our old fox--so?",BXS
ID,"is it not""?",BXS
ID,"""Then let us come at once,"" I cried, ""we are wasting the precious, precious time""!",BXS
ID,"The Professor did not move, but simply said:--  ""And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly""?",BXS
ID,"""Any way""!",BXS
ID,I cried.,BXS
ID,"""We shall break in if need be"".",BXS
ID,"""And your police; where will they be, and what will they say""?",BXS
ID,I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it.,BXS
ID,"So I said, as quietly as I could:--  ""Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am in"".",BXS
ID,"""Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish.",BXS
ID,"But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement.",BXS
ID,Then will come our time.,BXS
ID,"I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.",BXS
ID,"Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key; is it not so""?",BXS
ID,I nodded.,BXS
ID,"""Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get it; and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do""?",BXS
ID,"""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me"".",BXS
ID,"""And your police, they would interfere, would they not""?",BXS
ID,"""Oh, no!",BXS
ID,"not if they knew the man was properly employed"".",BXS
ID,"""Then,"" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, ""all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one.",BXS
ID,"Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!",BXS
ID,#NAME?,BXS
ID,"No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere.",BXS
ID,"I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in.",BXS
ID,"Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police.",BXS
ID,"Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them.",BXS
ID,"Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time.",BXS
ID,And your police and other authority help him all they can.,BXS
ID,And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been.,BXS
ID,This was all done _en ríÂgle_; and in our work we shall be _en ríÂgle_ too.,BXS
ID,"We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house"".",BXS
ID,I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing went on:--  ""When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End"".",BXS
ID,Lord Godalming stood up.,BXS
ID,"""I can be of some use here,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient"".",BXS
ID,"""Look here, old fellow,"" said Morris, ""it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?",BXS
ID,"It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to"".",BXS
ID,"""Friend Quincey is right""!",BXS
ID,said the Professor.,BXS
ID,"""His head is what you call in plane with the horizon.",BXS
ID,"It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may"".",BXS
ID,Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night.,BXS
ID,"She was very, very pale--almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence.",BXS
ID,"I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood.",BXS
ID,"As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear.",BXS
ID,"When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt.",BXS
ID,It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count's lair close at hand.,BXS
ID,"In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue.",BXS
ID,"As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.",BXS
ID,"It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there.",BXS
ID,"At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force.",BXS
ID,"To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection.",BXS
ID,"She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count's extraordinary power.",BXS
ID,"I had to give in, for Mina's resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that we should all work together.",BXS
ID,"""As for me,"" she said, ""I have no fear.",BXS
ID,Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort.,BXS
ID,"Go, my husband!",BXS
ID,"God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present"".",BXS
ID,"So I started up crying out: ""Then in God's name let us come at once, for we are losing time.",BXS
ID,"The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think"".",BXS
ID,"""Not so""!",BXS
ID,"said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.",BXS
ID,"""But why""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""Do you forget,"" he said, with actually a smile, ""that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late""?",BXS
ID,Did I forget!,BXS
ID,shall I ever--can I ever!,BXS
ID,Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene!,BXS
ID,"Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience.,BXS
ID,He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort.,BXS
ID,"When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her.",BXS
ID,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, ""dear, dear Madam Mina, alas!",BXS
ID,that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful.,BXS
ID,"These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not""?",BXS
ID,"He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--  ""No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together.",BXS
ID,"Now, you must all be going soon.",BXS
ID,"Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong"".",BXS
ID,Breakfast was a strange meal to us all.,BXS
ID,"We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us.",BXS
ID,"When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--  ""Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise.",BXS
ID,"Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack""?",BXS
ID,We all assured him.,BXS
ID,"""Then it is well.",BXS
ID,"Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall return!",BXS
ID,But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack.,BXS
ID,"I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter.",BXS
ID,Now let me guard yourself.,BXS
ID,"On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and----""  There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear.",BXS
ID,"As he had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal.",BXS
ID,My poor darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream.,BXS
ID,"But the words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement.",BXS
ID,"Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--  ""Unclean!",BXS
ID,Unclean!,BXS
ID,Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!,BXS
ID,"I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day"".",BXS
ID,They all paused.,BXS
ID,"I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight.",BXS
ID,"For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently.",BXS
ID,"Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--  ""It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon.",BXS
ID,"And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know.",BXS
ID,"For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us.",BXS
ID,"Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will.",BXS
ID,"It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man"".",BXS
ID,"There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.",BXS
ID,"Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it.",BXS
ID,"Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other.",BXS
ID,"We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.",BXS
ID,It was then time to start.,BXS
ID,"So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.",BXS
ID,"To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone.",BXS
ID,"I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.",BXS
ID,We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion.,BXS
ID,It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew.,BXS
ID,"Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task.",BXS
ID,"We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--  ""And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do.",BXS
ID,"We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use.",BXS
ID,He has chosen this earth because it has been holy.,BXS
ID,"Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still.",BXS
ID,"It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God"".",BXS
ID,"As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open.",BXS
ID,"The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor.",BXS
ID,"Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.",BXS
ID,"One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion of the Host.",BXS
ID,"When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--  ""So much is already done.",BXS
ID,"If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain""!",BXS
ID,As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum.,BXS
ID,"I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina.",BXS
ID,"I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished.",BXS
ID,She nodded in reply to show that she understood.,BXS
ID,"The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell.",BXS
ID,"It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.",BXS
ID,I have written this in the train.,BXS
ID,"""Quincey and I will find a locksmith.",BXS
ID,You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house.,BXS
ID,"But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better"".",BXS
ID,"I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on: ""Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us.",BXS
ID,"My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along.",BXS
ID,"You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across.",BXS
ID,"We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in"".",BXS
ID,"""The advice is good""!",BXS
ID,"said Van Helsing, so we said no more.",BXS
ID,"Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another.",BXS
ID,At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park.,BXS
ID,"My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours.",BXS
ID,"We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible.",BXS
ID,The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others.,BXS
ID,At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up.,BXS
ID,"Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools.",BXS
ID,"Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.",BXS
ID,"Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.",BXS
ID,"The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along.",BXS
ID,"The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him.",BXS
ID,"After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion.",BXS
ID,"Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark.",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it.",BXS
ID,"After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third.",BXS
ID,"All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall.",BXS
ID,"We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing's went cold altogether.",BXS
ID,We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag.,BXS
ID,"Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.",BXS
ID,"This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something.",BXS
ID,"The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.",BXS
ID,"When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door.",BXS
ID,"It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.",BXS
ID,"""The place smells so vilely,"" said the latter as we came in.",BXS
ID,It did indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely.,BXS
ID,"We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house.",BXS
ID,"In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth.",BXS
ID,"Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!",BXS
ID,"Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box.",BXS
ID,"First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house.",BXS
ID,"There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked.",BXS
ID,We did not lose any time in examining the chests.,BXS
ID,"With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel.",BXS
ID,"It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.",BXS
ID,"After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them.",BXS
ID,They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table.,BXS
ID,"There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink.",BXS
ID,All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust.,BXS
ID,"There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood.",BXS
ID,"Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses.",BXS
ID,"When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places.",BXS
ID,"The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of the Count.",BXS
ID,The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.,BXS
ID,The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time.,BXS
ID,"I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.",BXS
ID,The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.,BXS
ID,"Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair.",BXS
ID,"To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face.",BXS
ID,"His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame.",BXS
ID,"This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life.",BXS
ID,"Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----!",BXS
ID,"The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active.",BXS
ID,"What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest.",BXS
ID,"So well as I can remember, here it is:--  ""I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out.",BXS
ID,"All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it.",BXS
ID,"As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man.",BXS
ID,"Soldier, statesman, and alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time.",BXS
ID,"He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse.",BXS
ID,"He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay.",BXS
ID,"Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.",BXS
ID,"In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man's stature.",BXS
ID,"He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life"".",BXS
ID,"Harker groaned and said, ""And this is all arrayed against my darling!",BXS
ID,But how is he experimenting?,BXS
ID,"The knowledge may help us to defeat him""!",BXS
ID,"""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is working.",BXS
ID,"Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power.",BXS
ID,"However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow.",BXS
ID,"_Festina lente_ may well be his motto"".",BXS
ID,"""I fail to understand,"" said Harker wearily.",BXS
ID,"""Oh, do be more plain to me!",BXS
ID,"Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--  ""Ah, my child, I will be plain.",BXS
ID,"Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally.",BXS
ID,"How he has been making use of the zoí_phagous patient to effect his entry into friend John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate.",BXS
ID,But these are not his most important experiments.,BXS
ID,Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others.,BXS
ID,He knew not then but that must be so.,BXS
ID,"But all the time that so great child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box.",BXS
ID,"So he began to help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone.",BXS
ID,"And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden.",BXS
ID,He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.,BXS
ID,"So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding-place!",BXS
ID,"But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too late!",BXS
ID,Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so.,BXS
ID,Then he have no place where he can move and hide.,BXS
ID,I delayed this morning that so we might be sure.,BXS
ID,Is there not more at stake for us than for him?,BXS
ID,Then why we not be even more careful than him?,BXS
ID,"By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us.",BXS
ID,"To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance.",BXS
ID,See!,BXS
ID,"there are five of us when those absent ones return"".",BXS
ID,"Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman's knock of the telegraph boy.",BXS
ID,"We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.",BXS
ID,The boy handed in a despatch.,BXS
ID,"The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.",BXS
ID,"""Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South.",BXS
ID,"He seems to be going the round and may want to see you: Mina"".",BXS
ID,"There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--  ""Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet""!",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:--  ""God will act in His own way and time.",BXS
ID,"Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings"".",BXS
ID,"""I care for nothing now,"" he answered hotly, ""except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation.",BXS
ID,"I would sell my soul to do it""!",BXS
ID,"""Oh, hush, hush, my child""!",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""God does not purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith.",BXS
ID,"But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina.",BXS
ID,"Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words.",BXS
ID,"Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end.",BXS
ID,"The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change.",BXS
ID,"It will take him time to arrive here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick.",BXS
ID,"What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first"".",BXS
ID,"About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door.",BXS
ID,"It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly.",BXS
ID,"We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action.",BXS
ID,"The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris.",BXS
ID,"They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:--  ""It is all right.",BXS
ID,"We found both places; six boxes in each and we destroyed them all""!",BXS
ID,"""Destroyed""?",BXS
ID,asked the Professor.,BXS
ID,"""For him""!",BXS
ID,"We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--  ""There's nothing to do but to wait here.",BXS
ID,"If, however, he doesn't turn up by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset"".",BXS
ID,"""He will be here before long now,"" said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocket-book.",BXS
ID,"""_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one o'clock.",BXS
ID,That he went south has a meaning for us.,BXS
ID,He is as yet only suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least.,BXS
ID,You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him.,BXS
ID,That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next.,BXS
ID,This took him some time; for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way.,BXS
ID,"Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now.",BXS
ID,"We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance.",BXS
ID,"Hush, there is no time now.",BXS
ID,Have all your arms!,BXS
ID,"Be ready""!",BXS
ID,"He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.",BXS
ID,"I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself.",BXS
ID,"In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly.",BXS
ID,"Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively.",BXS
ID,"With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.",BXS
ID,Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window.,BXS
ID,We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness.,BXS
ID,"The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least he feared it.",BXS
ID,"Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him.",BXS
ID,"There was something so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.",BXS
ID,"The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house.",BXS
ID,"As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion-like disdain.",BXS
ID,"His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him.",BXS
ID,"It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do.",BXS
ID,I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything.,BXS
ID,"Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him.",BXS
ID,The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's leap back saved him.,BXS
ID,A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart.,BXS
ID,"As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out.",BXS
ID,"The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke.",BXS
ID,"Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand.",BXS
ID,I felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us.,BXS
ID,It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over the Count's face.,BXS
ID,"His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound.",BXS
ID,"The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window.",BXS
ID,"Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.",BXS
ID,"Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the ""ting"" of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging.",BXS
ID,We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.,BXS
ID,"He, rushing up the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.",BXS
ID,"There he turned and spoke to us:--  ""You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like sheep in a butcher's.",BXS
ID,"You shall be sorry yet, each one of you!",BXS
ID,You think you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more.,BXS
ID,My revenge is just begun!,BXS
ID,"I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side.",BXS
ID,"Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my jackals when I want to feed.",BXS
ID,"Bah""!",BXS
ID,"With a contemptuous sneer, he passed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him.",BXS
ID,A door beyond opened and shut.,BXS
ID,"The first of us to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.",BXS
ID,"""We have learnt something--much!",BXS
ID,"Notwithstanding his brave words, he fears us; he fear time, he fear want!",BXS
ID,"For if not, why he hurry so?",BXS
ID,"His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive.",BXS
ID,Why take that money?,BXS
ID,You follow quick.,BXS
ID,"You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so.",BXS
ID,"For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he return"".",BXS
ID,"As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match.",BXS
ID,"Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count.",BXS
ID,"He had, however, bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.,BXS
ID,"It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off.",BXS
ID,"We had to recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the Professor when he said:--  ""Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina.",BXS
ID,"All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her.",BXS
ID,But we need not despair.,BXS
ID,"There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find it; when that is done all may yet be well"".",BXS
ID,I could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker.,BXS
ID,The poor fellow was quite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he was thinking of his wife.,BXS
ID,"With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness.",BXS
ID,"When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--  ""I can never thank you all enough.",BXS
ID,"Oh, my poor darling""!",BXS
ID,"As she spoke, she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--""Lay your poor head here and rest it.",BXS
ID,"All will yet be well, dear!",BXS
ID,"God will protect us if He so will it in His good intent"".",BXS
ID,The poor fellow groaned.,BXS
ID,There was no place for words in his sublime misery.,BXS
ID,"We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat.",BXS
ID,"It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.",BXS
ID,"True to our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness.",BXS
ID,"When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come.",BXS
ID,"She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time.",BXS
ID,Then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up amongst us and spoke.,BXS
ID,"Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God.",BXS
ID,"""Jonathan,"" she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, ""Jonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time.",BXS
ID,I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter; but it is not a work of hate.,BXS
ID,That poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all.,BXS
ID,"Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality.",BXS
ID,"You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction"".",BXS
ID,"As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.",BXS
ID,"Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white.",BXS
ID,"She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever.",BXS
ID,"As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke:--  ""May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at.",BXS
ID,"If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it""!",BXS
ID,"""Oh, hush!",BXS
ID,"oh, hush!",BXS
ID,in the name of the good God.,BXS
ID,"Don't say such things, Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror.",BXS
ID,"Just think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that .",BXS
ID,"I, too, may need such pity; and that some other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me!",BXS
ID,"Oh, my husband!",BXS
ID,"my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man.",BXS
ID,"Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come"".",BXS
ID,We men were all in tears now.,BXS
ID,"There was no resisting them, and we wept openly.",BXS
ID,"She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.",BXS
ID,"Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress.",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone with their God.",BXS
ID,"Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.",BXS
ID,"She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her husband's sake, tried to seem content.",BXS
ID,"It was a brave struggle; and was, I think and believe, not without its reward.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.,BXS
ID,"When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady.",BXS
ID,"The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can.",BXS
ID,"Godalming has already turned in, for his is the second watch.",BXS
ID,"Now that my work is done I, too, shall go to bed.",BXS
ID,I thought yesterday would never end.,BXS
ID,"There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must now be for the better.",BXS
ID,"Before we parted, we discussed what our next step was to be, but we could arrive at no result.",BXS
ID,"All we knew was that one earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was.",BXS
ID,"If he chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the meantime!",BXS
ID,#NAME?,BXS
ID,"This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that one is my poor wronged darling.",BXS
ID,"I love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable.",BXS
ID,Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature.,BXS
ID,This is hope to me.,BXS
ID,"We are all drifting reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor.",BXS
ID,Thank God!,BXS
ID,"Mina is sleeping, and sleeping without dreams.",BXS
ID,"I fear what her dreams might be like, with such terrible memories to ground them in.",BXS
ID,"She has not been so calm, within my seeing, since the sunset.",BXS
ID,"Then, for a while, there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.",BXS
ID,"I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning.",BXS
ID,"I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary--weary to death.",BXS
ID,"However, I must try to sleep; for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me until.",BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,.,BXS
ID,"I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face.",BXS
ID,"I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--  ""Hush!",BXS
ID,"there is someone in the corridor""!",BXS
ID,"I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.",BXS
ID,"Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake.",BXS
ID,"He raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--  ""Hush!",BXS
ID,go back to bed; it is all right.,BXS
ID,One of us will be here all night.,BXS
ID,"We don't mean to take any chances""!",BXS
ID,"His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.",BXS
ID,"She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--  ""Oh, thank God for good brave men""!",BXS
ID,With a sigh she sank back again to sleep.,BXS
ID,"I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.",BXS
ID,Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina.,BXS
ID,"This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light.",BXS
ID,"She said to me hurriedly:--  ""Go, call the Professor.",BXS
ID,"I want to see him at once"".",BXS
ID,"""Why""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"""I have an idea.",BXS
ID,"I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured without my knowing it.",BXS
ID,"He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak.",BXS
ID,"Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close"".",BXS
ID,I went to the door.,BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing me, he sprang to his feet.",BXS
ID,"""Is anything wrong""?",BXS
ID,"he asked, in alarm.",BXS
ID,"""No,"" I replied; ""but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once"".",BXS
ID,"""I will go,"" he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.",BXS
ID,"In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions.",BXS
ID,"When the Professor saw Mina a smile--a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:--  ""Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change.",BXS
ID,See!,BXS
ID,"friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day""!",BXS
ID,"Then turning to her, he said, cheerfully: ""And what am I do for you?",BXS
ID,"For at this hour you do not want me for nothings"".",BXS
ID,"""I want you to hypnotise me""!",BXS
ID,she said.,BXS
ID,"""Do it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak freely.",BXS
ID,"Be quick, for the time is short""!",BXS
ID,Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.,BXS
ID,"Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn.",BXS
ID,"Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand.",BXS
ID,"Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive.",BXS
ID,"The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration.",BXS
ID,Mina opened her eyes; but she did not seem the same woman.,BXS
ID,"There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me.",BXS
ID,"Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.",BXS
ID,"They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on.",BXS
ID,Mina appeared not to see them.,BXS
ID,"The stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts:--  ""Where are you""?",BXS
ID,"The answer came in a neutral way:--  ""I do not know.",BXS
ID,"Sleep has no place it can call its own"".",BXS
ID,For several minutes there was silence.,BXS
ID,"Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe.",BXS
ID,"The room was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind.",BXS
ID,"I did so, and the day seemed just upon us.",BXS
ID,"A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room.",BXS
ID,"On the instant the Professor spoke again:--  ""Where are you now""?",BXS
ID,"The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it were as though she were interpreting something.",BXS
ID,I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.,BXS
ID,"""I do not know.",BXS
ID,"It is all strange to me""!",BXS
ID,"""What do you see""?",BXS
ID,"""I can see nothing; it is all dark"".",BXS
ID,"""What do you hear""?",BXS
ID,I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient voice.,BXS
ID,"""The lapping of water.",BXS
ID,"It is gurgling by, and little waves leap.",BXS
ID,"I can hear them on the outside"".",BXS
ID,"""Then you are on a ship""?",BXS
ID,"We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other.",BXS
ID,We were afraid to think.,BXS
ID,"The answer came quick:--  ""Oh, yes""!",BXS
ID,"""What else do you hear""?",BXS
ID,"""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about.",BXS
ID,"There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet"".",BXS
ID,"""What are you doing""?",BXS
ID,"""I am still--oh, so still.",BXS
ID,"It is like death""!",BXS
ID,"The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.",BXS
ID,"By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow.",BXS
ID,"She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her.",BXS
ID,"""Have I been talking in my sleep""?",BXS
ID,was all she said.,BXS
ID,"She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she was eager to know what she had told.",BXS
ID,"The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:--  ""Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late""!",BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm voice called them back:--  ""Stay, my friends.",BXS
ID,"That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor whilst she spoke.",BXS
ID,There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great Port of London.,BXS
ID,Which of them is it that you seek?,BXS
ID,"God be thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we know not.",BXS
ID,"We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men, since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen!",BXS
ID,"Alas, but that sentence is a puddle; is it not?",BXS
ID,"We can know now what was in the Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread.",BXS
ID,He meant escape.,BXS
ID,"Hear me, ESCAPE!",BXS
ID,"He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him.",BXS
ID,"He have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land.",BXS
ID,"He think to escape, but no!",BXS
ID,we follow him.,BXS
ID,Tally Ho!,BXS
ID,as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock!,BXS
ID,Our old fox is wily; oh!,BXS
ID,"so wily, and we must follow with wile.",BXS
ID,"I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a little while.",BXS
ID,"In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or slack tide.",BXS
ID,"See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to us.",BXS
ID,"Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need, and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us"".",BXS
ID,"Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--  ""But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us""?",BXS
ID,"He took her hand and patted it as he replied:--  ""Ask me nothings as yet.",BXS
ID,"When we have breakfast, then I answer all questions"".",BXS
ID,"He would say no more, and we separated to dress.",BXS
ID,After breakfast Mina repeated her question.,BXS
ID,"He looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully:--  ""Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell""!",BXS
ID,"She grew paler as she asked faintly:--  ""Why""?",BXS
ID,"""Because,"" he answered solemnly, ""he can live for centuries, and you are but mortal woman.",BXS
ID,"Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark upon your throat"".",BXS
ID,I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.,BXS
ID,This to Jonathan Harker.,BXS
ID,You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina.,BXS
ID,"We shall go to make our search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we seek confirmation only.",BXS
ID,But do you stay and take care of her to-day.,BXS
ID,This is your best and most holiest office.,BXS
ID,This day nothing can find him here.,BXS
ID,"Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already, for I have tell them.",BXS
ID,"He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back to his Castle in Transylvania.",BXS
ID,"I know it so well, as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall.",BXS
ID,"He have prepare for this in some way, and that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres.",BXS
ID,"For this he took the money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun go down.",BXS
ID,"It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.",BXS
ID,But there was not of time.,BXS
ID,When that fail he make straight for his last resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.,BXS
ID,"He is clever, oh, so clever!",BXS
ID,he know that his game here was finish; and so he decide he go back home.,BXS
ID,"He find ship going by the route he came, and he go in it.",BXS
ID,"We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound; when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all.",BXS
ID,Then we will comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope.,BXS
ID,For it will be hope when you think it over: that all is not lost.,BXS
ID,"This very creature that we pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out.",BXS
ID,"He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.",BXS
ID,"But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together.",BXS
ID,"Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina.",BXS
ID,"This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children.",BXS
ID,Therefore be of much comfort till we return.,BXS
ID,VAN HELSING.,BXS
ID,"When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably.",BXS
ID,Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort; and comfort is strength to her.,BXS
ID,"For my own part, now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to believe in it.",BXS
ID,Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem like a long-forgotten dream.,BXS
ID,Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight----  Alas!,BXS
ID,how can I disbelieve!,BXS
ID,In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead.,BXS
ID,"Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief.",BXS
ID,And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear.,BXS
ID,"Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again.",BXS
ID,"Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less.",BXS
ID,"There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.",BXS
ID,Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good.,BXS
ID,It may be!,BXS
ID,I shall try to think as she does.,BXS
ID,We have never spoken to each other yet of the future.,BXS
ID,It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations.,BXS
ID,The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again.,BXS
ID,It is now three o'clock.,BXS
ID,Our meeting for report.,BXS
ID,"Present: Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--  ""As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come.",BXS
ID,It was a dreary blank that was before us.,BXS
ID,_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night.,BXS
ID,"He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set.",BXS
ID,"These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small.",BXS
ID,There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go out with the tide.,BXS
ID,"She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube.",BXS
ID,'Soh!,BXS
ID,"' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.",BXS
ID,"' So off we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office.",BXS
ID,From him we inquire of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_.,BXS
ID,"He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us.",BXS
ID,"He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty.",BXS
ID,"They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.",BXS
ID,"""They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five o'clock comes a man so hurry.",BXS
ID,"A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning.",BXS
ID,"That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time.",BXS
ID,That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where.,BXS
ID,"Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him.",BXS
ID,"The captain come, when told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he agree to term.",BXS
ID,Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired.,BXS
ID,"He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship.",BXS
ID,"He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be.",BXS
ID,"But he say 'no'; that he come not yet, for that he have much to do.",BXS
ID,Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood.,BXS
ID,Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon.,BXS
ID,"The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing.",BXS
ID,"Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also.",BXS
ID,"And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed.",BXS
ID,"""No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as was expected.",BXS
ID,"A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.",BXS
ID,The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and blood; but he could do nothing.,BXS
ID,The water rose and rose; and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether.,BXS
ID,"He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed.",BXS
ID,Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and blood--were in hell.,BXS
ID,"But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog.",BXS
ID,"He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.",BXS
ID,"Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again.",BXS
ID,"My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf.",BXS
ID,"However, the ship went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth.",BXS
ID,"She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.",BXS
ID,"""And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth.",BXS
ID,"To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there.",BXS
ID,"Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should.",BXS
ID,"There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan.",BXS
ID,"We know all about where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be.",BXS
ID,"The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.",BXS
ID,"When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs.",BXS
ID,"It must be done by us alone and in our own way"".",BXS
ID,"When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship.",BXS
ID,"He replied: ""We have the best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning"".",BXS
ID,"I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh!",BXS
ID,"I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went.",BXS
ID,"He answered in growing passion, at first quietly.",BXS
ID,"As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men:--  ""Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary!",BXS
ID,"For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity.",BXS
ID,"This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing.",BXS
ID,"All this have I told these others; you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband.",BXS
ID,"I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries.",BXS
ID,"Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him.",BXS
ID,"With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way.",BXS
ID,"The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world.",BXS
ID,There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.,BXS
ID,"There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify.",BXS
ID,"Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities.",BXS
ID,"In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man.",BXS
ID,"In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too.",BXS
ID,"All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good.",BXS
ID,And now this is what he is to us.,BXS
ID,"He have infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good of you that I speak.",BXS
ID,"He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction, shall make you like to him.",BXS
ID,This must not be!,BXS
ID,We have sworn together that it must not.,BXS
ID,"Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him.",BXS
ID,"He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more.",BXS
ID,"Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause"".",BXS
ID,"He paused and I said:--  ""But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely?",BXS
ID,"Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted""?",BXS
ID,"""Aha""!",BXS
ID,"he said, ""your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him.",BXS
ID,"Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him.",BXS
ID,"This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl.",BXS
ID,"Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar.",BXS
ID,"In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be beaten back, but did he stay?",BXS
ID,No!,BXS
ID,"He come again, and again, and again.",BXS
ID,Look at his persistence and endurance.,BXS
ID,With the child-brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city.,BXS
ID,What does he do?,BXS
ID,He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him.,BXS
ID,Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task.,BXS
ID,"He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers.",BXS
ID,He study new tongues.,BXS
ID,"He learn new social life; new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was.",BXS
ID,"His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire.",BXS
ID,"Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises.",BXS
ID,He have done this alone; all alone!,BXS
ID,from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land.,BXS
ID,What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him.,BXS
ID,"He that can smile at death, as we know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples.",BXS
ID,"Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours.",BXS
ID,But we are pledged to set the world free.,BXS
ID,"Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength.",BXS
ID,"It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God"".",BXS
ID,"After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions.",BXS
ID,"To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action.",BXS
ID,I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night.,BXS
ID,It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me.,BXS
ID,"My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still unclean.",BXS
ID,"We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us.",BXS
ID,When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again.,BXS
ID,It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature.,BXS
ID,"Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.",BXS
ID,"More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.",BXS
ID,It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was brought back to reality.,BXS
ID,"Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent.",BXS
ID,"Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar.",BXS
ID,We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action.,BXS
ID,"I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied.",BXS
ID,"I _know_ that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance.",BXS
ID,"I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone.",BXS
ID,I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work.,BXS
ID,"The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called ""the Vampire's baptism of blood"".",BXS
ID,"Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything!",BXS
ID,"One thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us.",BXS
ID,The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech.,BXS
ID,I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!,BXS
ID,Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others.,BXS
ID,I shall try to open the subject with him.,BXS
ID,"When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things.",BXS
ID,"I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject.",BXS
ID,"After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--  ""Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate.",BXS
ID,"Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence""; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--  ""Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing"".",BXS
ID,A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing continued:--  ""With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far.",BXS
ID,"Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance.",BXS
ID,I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face.,BXS
ID,"It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge.",BXS
ID,"Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard.",BXS
ID,"But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy.",BXS
ID,"She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later.",BXS
ID,Now my fear is this.,BXS
ID,"If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know""?",BXS
ID,"I nodded acquiescence; he went on:--  ""Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not.",BXS
ID,This is a painful task!,BXS
ID,"Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.",BXS
ID,"When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us"".",BXS
ID,"He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured.",BXS
ID,I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt.,BXS
ID,"I told him, and the effect was as I expected.",BXS
ID,It is now close to the time of our general gathering.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it.",BXS
ID,I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.,BXS
ID,At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us.",BXS
ID,"The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved.",BXS
ID,"For my own part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted.",BXS
ID,"Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again.",BXS
ID,We went at once into our Plan of Campaign.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--  ""The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning.",BXS
ID,It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.,BXS
ID,"Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks.",BXS
ID,"Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest.",BXS
ID,"Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary.",BXS
ID,"Of course we shall all go armed--armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical"".",BXS
ID,"Here Quincey Morris added:--  ""I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us.",BXS
ID,I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament.,BXS
ID,I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around.,BXS
ID,"Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk?",BXS
ID,"What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater apiece""!",BXS
ID,"""Good""!",BXS
ID,"said Van Helsing, ""Winchesters it shall be.",BXS
ID,"Quincey's head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man.",BXS
ID,"In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon?",BXS
ID,It is as long to wait here as there.,BXS
ID,"To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey"".",BXS
ID,"""We four""?",BXS
ID,"said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.",BXS
ID,"""Of course""!",BXS
ID,"answered the Professor quickly, ""you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife""!",BXS
ID,"Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:--  ""Let us talk of that part of it in the morning.",BXS
ID,"I want to consult with Mina"".",BXS
ID,I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice.,BXS
ID,I looked at him significantly and coughed.,BXS
ID,For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.,BXS
ID,For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think.,BXS
ID,The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought.,BXS
ID,"Mina's determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess.",BXS
ID,I am as far as ever from a solution now.,BXS
ID,"The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us.",BXS
ID,"Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child.",BXS
ID,Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness.,BXS
ID,"Thank God, there are such moments still for her.",BXS
ID,How strange it all is.,BXS
ID,"I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be.",BXS
ID,"As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me.",BXS
ID,"All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--  ""Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour.",BXS
ID,"A promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears.",BXS
ID,"Quick, you must make it to me at once"".",BXS
ID,"""Mina,"" I said, ""a promise like that, I cannot make at once.",BXS
ID,"I may have no right to make it"".",BXS
ID,"""But, dear one,"" she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, ""it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.",BXS
ID,You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may do as you will.,BXS
ID,"Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved from the promise"".",BXS
ID,"""I promise""!",BXS
ID,"I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.",BXS
ID,"She said:--  ""Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count.",BXS
ID,"Not by word, or inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me""!",BXS
ID,and she solemnly pointed to the scar.,BXS
ID,"I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly:--  ""I promise""!",BXS
ID,and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.,BXS
ID,Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.,BXS
ID,"So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted.",BXS
ID,We all retired early.,BXS
ID,Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble.,BXS
ID,"Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.",BXS
ID,Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night.,BXS
ID,I shall try it.,BXS
ID,Oh!,BXS
ID,for a dreamless sleep.,BXS
ID,Another surprise.,BXS
ID,"Mina woke me early, about the same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,"I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went for the Professor.",BXS
ID,"He had evidently expected some such call, for I found him dressed in his room.",BXS
ID,"His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room.",BXS
ID,"He came at once; as he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.",BXS
ID,"""No,"" she said quite simply, ""it will not be necessary.",BXS
ID,You can tell them just as well.,BXS
ID,"I must go with you on your journey"".",BXS
ID,Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was.,BXS
ID,"After a moment's pause he asked:--  ""But why""?",BXS
ID,"""You must take me with you.",BXS
ID,"I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too"".",BXS
ID,"""But why, dear Madam Mina?",BXS
ID,You know that your safety is our solemnest duty.,BXS
ID,"We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been"".",BXS
ID,"He paused, embarrassed.",BXS
ID,"As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--  ""I know.",BXS
ID,That is why I must go.,BXS
ID,"I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again.",BXS
ID,I know that when the Count wills me I must go.,BXS
ID,"I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan"".",BXS
ID,"God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour.",BXS
ID,I could only clasp her hand.,BXS
ID,I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears.,BXS
ID,"She went on:--  ""You men are brave and strong.",BXS
ID,"You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone.",BXS
ID,"Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even I myself do not know"".",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:--  ""Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise.",BXS
ID,"You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve"".",BXS
ID,"When he had spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her.",BXS
ID,She had fallen back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room.,BXS
ID,Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly.,BXS
ID,"We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.",BXS
ID,"He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--  ""In the morning we shall leave for Varna.",BXS
ID,We have now to deal with a new factor: Madam Mina.,BXS
ID,"Oh, but her soul is true.",BXS
ID,"It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are warned in time.",BXS
ID,"There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives"".",BXS
ID,"""What shall we do exactly""?",BXS
ID,asked Mr. Morris laconically.,BXS
ID,"The Professor paused before replying:--  ""We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it.",BXS
ID,"This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the superstition.",BXS
ID,"And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still.",BXS
ID,"Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and--and all will be well"".",BXS
ID,"""I shall not wait for any opportunity,"" said Morris.",BXS
ID,"""When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment""!",BXS
ID,I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.,BXS
ID,I think he understood my look; I hope he did.,BXS
ID,"""Good boy,"" said Dr. Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,"""Brave boy.",BXS
ID,Quincey is all man.,BXS
ID,God bless him for it.,BXS
ID,"My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear.",BXS
ID,I do but say what we may do--what we must do.,BXS
ID,"But, indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do.",BXS
ID,"There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say.",BXS
ID,"We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack.",BXS
ID,Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order.,BXS
ID,"Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be.",BXS
ID,"As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel.",BXS
ID,"I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey"".",BXS
ID,"There was nothing further to be said, and we parted.",BXS
ID,"I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come.",BXS
ID,"It is all done; my will is made, and all complete.",BXS
ID,Mina if she survive is my sole heir.,BXS
ID,"If it should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.",BXS
ID,It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls my attention to it.,BXS
ID,I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal.,BXS
ID,"These occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a good end.",BXS
ID,"I write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.",BXS
ID,She is calling to me.,BXS
ID,"Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.",BXS
ID,I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.,BXS
ID,"We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action.",BXS
ID,"This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon.",BXS
ID,"At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.",BXS
ID,"To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle.",BXS
ID,I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so.,BXS
ID,"A very few minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close.",BXS
ID,"Taking her husband's hand in hers began:--  ""We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time!",BXS
ID,"I know, dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end"".",BXS
ID,"This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers.",BXS
ID,"""In the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us.",BXS
ID,You are going to be so good to me as to take me with you.,BXS
ID,"I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake--you will do.",BXS
ID,But you must remember that I am not as you are.,BXS
ID,"There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us.",BXS
ID,"Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it""!",BXS
ID,"She looked appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.",BXS
ID,"""What is that way""?",BXS
ID,asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.,BXS
ID,"""What is that way, which we must not--may not--take""?",BXS
ID,"""That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.",BXS
ID,"I know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy's.",BXS
ID,"Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the friends who love me.",BXS
ID,But death is not all.,BXS
ID,"I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God's will.",BXS
ID,"Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds""!",BXS
ID,"We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude.",BXS
ID,The faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming.,BXS
ID,"She continued:--  ""This is what I can give into the hotch-pot"".",BXS
ID,"I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all seriousness.",BXS
ID,"""What will each of you give?",BXS
ID,"Your lives I know,"" she went on quickly, ""that is easy for brave men.",BXS
ID,"Your lives are God's, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me""?",BXS
ID,"She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face.",BXS
ID,"Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up.",BXS
ID,"""Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now.",BXS
ID,"You must promise me, one and all--even you, my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me"".",BXS
ID,"""What is that time""?",BXS
ID,"The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and strained.",BXS
ID,"""When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die that I may live.",BXS
ID,"When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest""!",BXS
ID,Quincey was the first to rise after the pause.,BXS
ID,"He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--  ""I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.",BXS
ID,"And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come""!",BXS
ID,"""My true friend""!",BXS
ID,"was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.",BXS
ID,"""I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina""!",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing.,BXS
ID,"""And I""!",BXS
ID,"said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath.",BXS
ID,"I followed, myself.",BXS
ID,"Then her husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and asked:--  ""And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife""?",BXS
ID,"""You too, my dearest,"" she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes.",BXS
ID,"""You must not shrink.",BXS
ID,"You are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time.",BXS
ID,"Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy.",BXS
ID,Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them.,BXS
ID,"It is men's duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial!",BXS
ID,"And oh, my dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved""--she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--""to him who had best right to give her peace.",BXS
ID,"If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me"".",BXS
ID,"""Again I swear""!",BXS
ID,came the Professor's resonant voice.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said:--  ""And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget: this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.",BXS
ID,At such a time I myself might be--nay!,BXS
ID,"if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued with your enemy against you"".",BXS
ID,"""One more request;"" she became very solemn as she said this, ""it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for me, if you will"".",BXS
ID,"We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to speak:--  ""I want you to read the Burial Service"".",BXS
ID,"She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: ""You must read it over me some day.",BXS
ID,"Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us.",BXS
ID,"You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may""!",BXS
ID,"""But oh, my dear one,"" he pleaded, ""death is afar off from you"".",BXS
ID,"""Nay,"" she said, holding up a warning hand.",BXS
ID,"""I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me""!",BXS
ID,"""Oh, my wife, must I read it""?",BXS
ID,"he said, before he began.",BXS
ID,"""It would comfort me, my husband""!",BXS
ID,was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.,BXS
ID,"""How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness.",BXS
ID,"Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead.",BXS
ID,"I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me""!",BXS
ID,She was right in her instinct.,BXS
ID,"Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.",BXS
ID,"We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express.",BXS
ID,"We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o'clock.",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--""the Odessus"".",BXS
ID,"The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them.",BXS
ID,Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.,BXS
ID,Thank God!,BXS
ID,"Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back.",BXS
ID,She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time.,BXS
ID,"Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times.",BXS
ID,"At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed.",BXS
ID,"He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him.",BXS
ID,He always asks her what she can see and hear.,BXS
ID,"She answers to the first:--  ""Nothing; all is dark"".",BXS
ID,"And to the second:--  ""I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by.",BXS
ID,Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak.,BXS
ID,"The wind is high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam"".",BXS
ID,"It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna.",BXS
ID,Lord Godalming has just returned.,BXS
ID,"He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.",BXS
ID,He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.,BXS
ID,"He was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.",BXS
ID,We had dinner and went to bed early.,BXS
ID,"To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset.,BXS
ID,"The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and so cannot leave the ship.",BXS
ID,As he dare not change to man's form without suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the box.,BXS
ID,"If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes.",BXS
ID,What mercy he shall get from us will not count for much.,BXS
ID,We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen.,BXS
ID,Thank God!,BXS
ID,"this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money.",BXS
ID,"We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe.",BXS
ID,"Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!",BXS
ID,"Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring winds.",BXS
ID,"We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready.",BXS
ID,As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.,BXS
ID,"Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour.",BXS
ID,"Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.",BXS
ID,"The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna.",BXS
ID,"We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done.",BXS
ID,We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open.,BXS
ID,"If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart.",BXS
ID,"Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready.",BXS
ID,"The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body, it will soon after fall into dust.",BXS
ID,"In such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused.",BXS
ID,"But even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope.",BXS
ID,"For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come.",BXS
ID,We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent.,BXS
ID,"We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the _Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.",BXS
ID,A whole week of waiting.,BXS
ID,"Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: ""Not yet reported"".",BXS
ID,"Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.",BXS
ID,"""_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles"".",BXS
ID,How I miss my phonograph!,BXS
ID,To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must.,BXS
ID,We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's.,BXS
ID,I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.",BXS
ID,"After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence.",BXS
ID,"In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks.",BXS
ID,"The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.",BXS
ID,"We talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others.",BXS
ID,It would break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her.",BXS
ID,"If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!",BXS
ID,"We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other.",BXS
ID,We should neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.,BXS
ID,"""Euthanasia"" is an excellent and a comforting word!",BXS
ID,I am grateful to whoever invented it.,BXS
ID,"It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London.",BXS
ID,"She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early.",BXS
ID,"We shall get up at one o'clock, so as to be ready.",BXS
ID,No news yet of the ship's arrival.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.",BXS
ID,"We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him.",BXS
ID,"It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that ""Kukri"" ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!",BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day.,BXS
ID,"About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it.",BXS
ID,"She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping.",BXS
ID,"When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.",BXS
ID,She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else.,BXS
ID,"Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.",BXS
ID,"Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days.",BXS
ID,At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.,BXS
ID,"Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination.",BXS
ID,"To his doom, I trust!",BXS
ID,Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.,BXS
ID,She ought to be here by now.,BXS
ID,"That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same.",BXS
ID,"It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port.",BXS
ID,"We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.",BXS
ID,Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.,BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: ""lapping waves and rushing water,"" though she added that ""the waves were very faint"".",BXS
ID,"The telegrams from London have been the same: ""no further report"".",BXS
ID,"Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us.",BXS
ID,"He added significantly:--  ""I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's.",BXS
ID,"Souls and memories can do strange things during trance"".",BXS
ID,"I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand.",BXS
ID,We must try to-night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.,BXS
ID,When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected.,BXS
ID,"True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.",BXS
ID,The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the change would occur.,BXS
ID,"None the less, however, was it a surprise.",BXS
ID,"I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be.",BXS
ID,"Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man.",BXS
ID,It was an odd experience and we all took it differently.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.",BXS
ID,I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another.,BXS
ID,"Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering days it meant ""action"".",BXS
ID,"Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer.",BXS
ID,"Harker smiled--actually smiled--the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there.",BXS
ID,"""When does the next train start for Galatz""?",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing to us generally.,BXS
ID,"""At 6:30 to-morrow morning""!",BXS
ID,"We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.",BXS

ID,murmured the Professor.,BXS
ID,"""Can't we get a special""?",BXS
ID,asked Lord Godalming.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing shook his head: ""I fear not.",BXS
ID,"This land is very different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train.",BXS
ID,"Moreover, we have something to prepare.",BXS
ID,We must think.,BXS
ID,Now let us organize.,BXS
ID,"You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.",BXS

ID,"""And I,"" said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, ""shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do.",BXS
ID,"Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late""!",BXS
ID,"The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance.",BXS
ID,"We said nothing at the time, however.",BXS
ID,When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle.,BXS

ID,"And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk; but I believe it is right.",BXS
ID,"In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me.",BXS
ID,"In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.",BXS
ID,"He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.",BXS
ID,Now he make his most effort to escape us.,BXS
ID,At present he want her not.,BXS

ID,Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!,BXS
ID,"She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether--though he think not so.",BXS
ID,Hush!,BXS
ID,"let me speak, and you shall learn.",BXS
ID,"Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits.",BXS
ID,"I fear, as I never feared before.",BXS
ID,We can only trust the good God.,BXS
ID,Silence!,BXS
ID,"here she comes""!",BXS
ID,"I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery.",BXS
ID,"As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,"He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read.",BXS
ID,"Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:--  ""Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think.",BXS
ID,"A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings.",BXS
ID,"Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings.",BXS
ID,"Nay, like the ""Ugly Duck"" of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them.",BXS
ID,"See I read here what Jonathan have written:--  ""That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph"".",BXS
ID,"""What does this tell us?",BXS
ID,Not much?,BXS
ID,no!,BXS
ID,The Count's child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free.,BXS
ID,"Your man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now.",BXS
ID,No!,BXS
ID,"But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean--what it _might_ mean.",BXS
ID,"Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then pouf!",BXS
ID,"and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues.",BXS
ID,Is it not so?,BXS
ID,"Well, I shall explain.",BXS
ID,"To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime?",BXS
ID,'Yes' and 'No.,BXS
ID,"' You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity.",BXS
ID,"You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not but once.",BXS
ID,"Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad universale_.",BXS
ID,There is this peculiarity in criminals.,BXS
ID,"It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_.",BXS
ID,That is to be empiric.,BXS
ID,"The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.",BXS
ID,This criminal has not full man-brain.,BXS
ID,He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain.,BXS
ID,He be of child-brain in much.,BXS
ID,"Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done.",BXS
ID,"The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more.",BXS
ID,"'_Dos pou sto_,' said Archimedes.",BXS
ID,"'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!",BXS
ID,"' To do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before!",BXS
ID,"Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,"" for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled.",BXS
ID,"He went on:--  ""Now you shall speak.",BXS
ID,"Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes"".",BXS
ID,He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.,BXS
ID,"His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke:--  ""The Count is a criminal and of criminal type.",BXS
ID,"Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and _quí¢_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.",BXS
ID,"Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.",BXS
ID,"His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a 'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort.",BXS
ID,He came again better equipped for his work; and won.,BXS
ID,So he came to London to invade a new land.,BXS
ID,"He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land"".",BXS
ID,"""Good, good!",BXS
ID,"oh, you so clever lady""!",BXS
ID,"said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.",BXS
ID,"A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:--  ""Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement.",BXS
ID,"I have hope"".",BXS
ID,"Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation:--  ""But go on.",BXS
ID,Go on!,BXS
ID,there is more to tell if you will.,BXS
ID,Be not afraid; John and I know.,BXS
ID,"I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.",BXS

ID,"""I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical"".",BXS
ID,"""Nay!",BXS
ID,"fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think"".",BXS
ID,"""Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose.",BXS
ID,That purpose is remorseless.,BXS
ID,"As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.",BXS
ID,So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.,BXS
ID,I felt it!,BXS
ID,"Oh, I felt it!",BXS
ID,"Thank God, for His great mercy!",BXS
ID,"My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends"".",BXS
ID,"The Professor stood up:--  ""He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.",BXS
ID,"But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm.",BXS
ID,"The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says.",BXS
ID,"For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep.",BXS
ID,"He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail!",BXS
ID,"That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set.",BXS
ID,"At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands.",BXS
ID,"This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where.",BXS
ID,"We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours.",BXS
ID,We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him.,BXS
ID,"Friend John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way.",BXS
ID,"You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do"".",BXS
ID,"And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS.",BXS
ID,to us.,BXS
ID,This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz.,BXS
ID,Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset.,BXS
ID,"Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz.",BXS
ID,"When the usual time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance.",BXS
ID,"Usually she speaks on a hint; but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--  ""I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.",BXS
ID,"I can hear men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks.",BXS
ID,A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.,BXS
ID,"There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along.",BXS
ID,What is this?,BXS
ID,"There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me"".",BXS
ID,Here she stopped.,BXS
ID,"She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight.",BXS
ID,Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.,BXS
ID,"Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri.",BXS
ID,There was a long pause.,BXS
ID,We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything.,BXS
ID,"Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--  ""Would none of you like a cup of tea?",BXS
ID,"You must all be so tired""!",BXS
ID,"We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced.",BXS
ID,"She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--  ""You see, my friends.",BXS
ID,_He_ is close to land: he has left his earth-chest.,BXS
ID,But he has yet to get on shore.,BXS
ID,"In the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land.",BXS
ID,"In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby.",BXS
ID,"But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape.",BXS
ID,"And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain.",BXS
ID,"Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.",BXS
ID,"We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered"".",BXS
ID,"There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.",BXS
ID,"Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance.",BXS
ID,The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair.,BXS
ID,"Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made reply:--  ""All is dark.",BXS
ID,"I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood"".",BXS
ID,"She paused, and the red sun shot up.",BXS
ID,We must wait till to-night.,BXS
ID,And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation.,BXS
ID,"We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun-up.",BXS
ID,Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening.,BXS
ID,Sunset has come and gone.,BXS
ID,"Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.",BXS
ID,Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning.,BXS
ID,"I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's sensations may die away, just when we want it most.",BXS
ID,It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work.,BXS
ID,Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts.,BXS
ID,If this goes on it may ultimately mislead us.,BXS
ID,If I thought that the Count's power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so.,BXS
ID,"When she did speak, her words were enigmatical:--  ""Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind.",BXS
ID,"I can hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves"".",BXS
ID,"She stopped and a shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy.",BXS
ID,"She said no more, even in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning.",BXS
ID,"When she woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert.",BXS
ID,"She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence.",BXS
ID,"We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later.",BXS
ID,Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.,BXS
ID,"Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance, Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual.",BXS
ID,"They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose.",BXS
ID,"The Professor lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--  ""All is dark.",BXS
ID,"I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood.",BXS
ID,Cattle low far off.,BXS
ID,"There is another sound, a queer one like----"" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.",BXS
ID,"""Go on; go on!",BXS
ID,"Speak, I command you""!",BXS
ID,said Van Helsing in an agonised voice.,BXS
ID,"At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face.",BXS
ID,"She opened her eyes, and we all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:--  ""Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't?",BXS
ID,"I don't remember anything"".",BXS
ID,"Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--  ""What have I said?",BXS
ID,What have I done?,BXS
ID,"I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on!",BXS
ID,"speak, I command you!",BXS
ID,"' It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child""!",BXS
ID,"""Oh, Madam Mina,"" he said, sadly, ""it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to obey""!",BXS
ID,The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz.,BXS
ID,We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.,BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language.",BXS
ID,"The forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry.",BXS
ID,Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the _Czarina Catherine_.,BXS
ID,_Later.,BXS
ID,_--Lord Godalming has returned.,BXS
ID,"The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.",BXS
ID,"He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.",BXS
ID,"At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs.",BXS
ID,"Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood.",BXS
ID,"They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord Godalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power.",BXS
ID,"They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour.",BXS
ID,"There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage.",BXS
ID,He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.,BXS
ID,"""Man""!",BXS
ID,"he said, ""but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the average.",BXS
ID,"It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his ain purpose.",BXS
ID,An' a' the time we could no speer a thing.,BXS
ID,"Gin we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see.",BXS
ID,"We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o' aught.",BXS
ID,"At first I inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no.",BXS
ID,"If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin' him"".",BXS
ID,"This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--  ""Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match""!",BXS
ID,"The skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:--  ""When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started frae London.",BXS
ID,"I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye.",BXS
ID,Man!,BXS
ID,but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous!,BXS
ID,"I sent them aboot their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was agin the big box.",BXS
ID,"Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet.",BXS
ID,"An' if he didn't, well, we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow.",BXS
ID,"Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.",BXS
ID,"The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river.",BXS
ID,"I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.",BXS
ID,"They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither.",BXS
ID,"We didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula.",BXS
ID,Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand.,BXS
ID,"He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it.",BXS
ID,"If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither than that same""!",BXS
ID,"""What was the name of the man who took it""?",BXS
ID,asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.,BXS
ID,"""I'll be tellin' ye quick""!",BXS
ID,"he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed ""Immanuel Hildesheim"".",BXS
ID,Burgen-strasse 16 was the address.,BXS
ID,We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we came away.,BXS
ID,"We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez.",BXS
ID,His arguments were pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew.,BXS
ID,This turned out to be simple but important.,BXS
ID,"He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_.",BXS
ID,"This he was to give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port.",BXS
ID,"He had been paid for his work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank.",BXS
ID,"When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage.",BXS
ID,That was all he knew.,BXS
ID,"We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him.",BXS
ID,"One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither.",BXS
ID,"This was corroborated by his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money.",BXS
ID,This had been between ten and eleven o'clock last night.,BXS
ID,We were at a standstill again.,BXS
ID,"Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal.",BXS
ID,"Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out ""This is the work of a Slovak""!",BXS
ID,"We hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.",BXS
ID,As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion.,BXS
ID,"We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover.",BXS
ID,With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to Mina.,BXS
ID,"When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence.",BXS
ID,"Things are getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one.",BXS
ID,"As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.",BXS
ID,They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up to the moment.,BXS
ID,"I feel so grateful to the man who invented the ""Traveller's"" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for me.",BXS
ID,I should have felt quite; astray doing the work if I had to write with a pen.,BXS
ID,"It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now.",BXS
ID,"He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse.",BXS
ID,His brows are knit; his face is drawn with pain.,BXS
ID,"Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts.",BXS

ID,I am more than ever sure that I am right.,BXS

ID,(Entered in her Journal.,BXS
ID,)  _Ground of inquiry.,BXS
ID,_--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own place.,BXS
ID,(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one.,BXS
ID,"This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way.",BXS
ID,"He evidently fears discovery or interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.",BXS

ID,"(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate.",BXS
ID,"A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.",BXS
ID,"(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.",BXS
ID,(_z_) His pursuers might follow.,BXS
ID,"This is his highest fear; and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim--me!",BXS
ID,There is no one in charge of the box.,BXS
ID,"It would have to take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track.",BXS
ID,"True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to?",BXS
ID,This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.,BXS
ID,"Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another.",BXS
ID,On the water he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves.,BXS
ID,"But were he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost.",BXS
ID,"He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.",BXS
ID,We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain _what_ water.,BXS
ID,"The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task is to be.",BXS
ID,_Firstly.,BXS
ID,"_--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.",BXS
ID,"_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.",BXS
ID,"As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.",BXS
ID,"The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_.",BXS
ID,There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky.,BXS
ID,"These we must only guess at; but there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.",BXS
ID,"That, so far, his plans were successful we know.",BXS
ID,"The _Czarina Catherine_ made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz.",BXS
ID,"That the Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved.",BXS
ID,"Hildesheim cleared the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky.",BXS
ID,Skinsky took it--and here we lose the trail.,BXS
ID,"We only know that the box is somewhere on the water, moving along.",BXS
ID,"The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.",BXS
ID,"Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on land_, at Galatz.",BXS
ID,The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise.,BXS
ID,At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form.,BXS
ID,"Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work?",BXS
ID,"In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general feeling against his class.",BXS
ID,The Count wanted isolation.,BXS
ID,"My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way.",BXS
ID,"He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.",BXS
ID,Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service.,BXS
ID,"When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river.",BXS
ID,"When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.",BXS
ID,I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.,BXS
ID,I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood.,BXS
ID,"The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream.",BXS
ID,There would be no such sound if floating down stream.,BXS
ID,"Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further.",BXS
ID,"Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass.",BXS
ID,The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.,BXS
ID,"When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me.",BXS
ID,"The others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--  ""Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher.",BXS
ID,Her eyes have been where we were blinded.,BXS
ID,"Now we are on the track once again, and this time we may succeed.",BXS
ID,"Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on the water, our task will be over.",BXS
ID,"He has a start, but he is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish.",BXS
ID,"This he knows, and will not.",BXS
ID,"Now men, to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do"".",BXS
ID,"""I shall get a steam launch and follow him,"" said Lord Godalming.",BXS
ID,"""And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,"" said Mr. Morris.",BXS
ID,"""Good""!",BXS
ID,"said the Professor, ""both good.",BXS
ID,But neither must go alone.,BXS
ID,"There must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms"".",BXS
ID,"All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a small arsenal.",BXS
ID,"Said Mr. Morris:--  ""I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves.",BXS
ID,"The Count, if you remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or understand.",BXS
ID,"We must be ready at all points"".",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward said:--  ""I think I had better go with Quincey.",BXS
ID,"We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come along.",BXS
ID,"You must not be alone, Art.",BXS
ID,"It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry guns--would undo all our plans.",BXS
ID,"There must be no chances, this time; we shall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate"".",BXS
ID,"He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me.",BXS
ID,I could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind.,BXS
ID,"Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the .",BXS
ID,Vampire.,BXS
ID,(Why did I hesitate to write the word?,BXS
ID,") He was silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--  ""Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons.",BXS
ID,"First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has wrought such woe to you and yours.",BXS
ID,"Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may.",BXS
ID,I am old.,BXS
ID,"My legs are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal weapons.",BXS
ID,But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way.,BXS
ID,"And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men.",BXS
ID,"Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's country.",BXS
ID,"Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula.",BXS
ID,"Here, Madam Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place.",BXS
ID,"There is much to be done, and other places to be made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated"".",BXS
ID,"Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--  ""Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina, in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right into the jaws of his death-trap?",BXS
ID,Not for the world!,BXS
ID,"Not for Heaven or Hell""!",BXS
ID,"He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--  ""Do you know what the place is?",BXS
ID,"Have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?",BXS
ID,"Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat""?",BXS
ID,"Here he turned to me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry: ""Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us""!",BXS
ID,and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery.,BXS
ID,"The Professor's voice, as he spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed us all:--  ""Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful place that I would go.",BXS
ID,God forbid that I should take her into that place.,BXS
ID,"There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not see.",BXS
ID,"We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify.",BXS
ID,Remember that we are in terrible straits.,BXS
ID,"If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then in time our dear one""--he took my hand--""would come to him to keep him company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw.",BXS
ID,You have told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them.,BXS
ID,You shudder; and well may it be.,BXS
ID,"Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is necessary.",BXS
ID,"My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving, possibly my life?",BXS
ID,"If it were that any one went into that place to stay, it is I who would have to go to keep them company"".",BXS
ID,"""Do as you will,"" said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, ""we are in the hands of God""!",BXS
ID,"Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.",BXS
ID,"How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and so brave!",BXS
ID,"And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!",BXS
ID,What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used.,BXS
ID,"I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely.",BXS
ID,"For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour.",BXS
ID,"It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice.",BXS
ID,"Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed.",BXS
ID,We have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had.,BXS
ID,"Professor Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti, where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass.",BXS
ID,"We are bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and horses.",BXS
ID,"We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter.",BXS
ID,"The Professor knows something of a great many languages, so we shall get on all right.",BXS
ID,"We have all got arms, even for me a large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like the rest.",BXS
ID,Alas!,BXS
ID,I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my forehead forbids that.,BXS
ID,"Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as warnings.",BXS
ID,It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling.,BXS
ID,We may never meet again.,BXS
ID,"Courage, Mina!",BXS
ID,the Professor is looking at you keenly; his look is a warning.,BXS
ID,There must be no tears now--unless it may be that God will let them fall in gladness.,BXS
ID,I am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up.,BXS
ID,"He is an experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads.",BXS
ID,"Regarding our plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one.",BXS
ID,"We took it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the Carpathians.",BXS
ID,"We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough.",BXS
ID,"Lord Godalming tells me to sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch.",BXS
ID,"But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.",BXS
ID,My only comfort is that we are in the hands of God.,BXS
ID,"Only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started; they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves.",BXS
ID,"They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity.",BXS
ID,"When they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look after the horses.",BXS
ID,It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they can mount our whole party.,BXS
ID,"One of the saddles has a movable horn, and can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.",BXS
ID,It is a wild adventure we are on.,BXS
ID,"Here, as we are rushing along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home.",BXS
ID,We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into a whole world of dark and dreadful things.,BXS
ID,Godalming is shutting the furnace door.,BXS
ID,Still hurrying along.,BXS
ID,"The day has come, and Godalming is sleeping.",BXS
ID,I am on watch.,BXS
ID,"The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats.",BXS
ID,"As yet we have passed only a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek.",BXS
ID,"The men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and prayed.",BXS
ID,No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek.,BXS
ID,We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone.,BXS
ID,"We have over-hauled every boat, big and little.",BXS
ID,"Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly.",BXS
ID,"We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously.",BXS
ID,"With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do.",BXS
ID,"Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them, going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board.",BXS
ID,"This was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth.",BXS
ID,"At Fundu we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the night.",BXS
ID,"I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me, and nature must have rest some time.",BXS
ID,Godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch.,BXS
ID,God bless him for all his goodness to poor dear Mina and me.,BXS
ID,It is broad daylight.,BXS
ID,That good fellow would not wake me.,BXS
ID,"He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble.",BXS
ID,"It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right.",BXS
ID,"I am a new man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and keeping watch.",BXS
ID,I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me.,BXS
ID,"I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing.",BXS
ID,They should have got to Veresti about noon on Wednesday.,BXS
ID,"It would take them some time to get the carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they would be about now at the Borgo Pass.",BXS
ID,God guide and help them!,BXS
ID,I am afraid to think what may happen.,BXS
ID,If we could only go faster!,BXS
ID,but we cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost.,BXS
ID,I wonder how Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on.,BXS
ID,"There seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have met much obstruction.",BXS
ID,"I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next.",BXS
ID,Three days on the road.,BXS
ID,"No news, and no time to write it if there had been, for every moment is precious.",BXS
ID,We have had only the rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.,BXS
ID,Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful.,BXS
ID,We must push on; we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.,BXS
ID,We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the Bistritza.,BXS
ID,I wish it wasn't so cold.,BXS
ID,There are signs of snow coming; and if it falls heavy it will stop us.,BXS
ID,"In such case we must get a sledge and go on, Russian fashion.",BXS
ID,To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids.,BXS
ID,"The Slovak boats get up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge.",BXS
ID,Some went up only a few hours before.,BXS
ID,"Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again.",BXS
ID,"Finally, they got up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase afresh.",BXS
ID,"I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight.",BXS
ID,We must push on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.,BXS
ID,Arrived at Veresti at noon.,BXS
ID,"The Professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I could say was: ""dark and quiet"".",BXS
ID,He is off now buying a carriage and horses.,BXS
ID,"He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so that we may be able to change them on the way.",BXS
ID,We have something more than 70 miles before us.,BXS
ID,"The country is lovely, and most interesting; if only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to see it all.",BXS
ID,If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be.,BXS
ID,"To stop and see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people!",BXS
ID,"But, alas!",BXS
ID,Dr. Van Helsing has returned.,BXS
ID,"He has got the carriage and horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour.",BXS
ID,The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough for a company of soldiers.,BXS
ID,"The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again.",BXS
ID,"He has been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps, and all sorts of warm things.",BXS
ID,There will not be any chance of our being cold.,BXS
ID,We shall soon be off.,BXS
ID,I am afraid to think what may happen to us.,BXS
ID,We are truly in the hands of God.,BXS
ID,"He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.",BXS
ID,"All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed.",BXS
ID,"The horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best speed.",BXS
ID,We have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one.,BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses.",BXS
ID,"We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go.",BXS
ID,"It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities.",BXS
ID,"They are _very, very_ superstitious.",BXS
ID,"In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.",BXS
ID,I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic.,BXS
ID,"Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their suspicions.",BXS
ID,"We are travelling fast, and as we have no driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way.",BXS
ID,"The Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he made me sleep for a long spell.",BXS
ID,"At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he says that I answered as usual ""darkness, lapping water and creaking wood""; so our enemy is still on the river.",BXS
ID,"I am afraid to think of Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself.",BXS
ID,I write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready.,BXS
ID,"Dr. Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution.",BXS
ID,When we have well started I must make him rest whilst I drive.,BXS
ID,"I shall tell him that we have days before us, and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed.",BXS
ID,All is ready; we are off shortly.,BXS
ID,"I was successful, and we took turns driving all night; now the day is on us, bright though cold.",BXS
ID,There is a strange heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean that it oppresses us both.,BXS
ID,"It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep us comfortable.",BXS
ID,"At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered ""darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,"" so the river is changing as they ascend.",BXS
ID,I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.,BXS
ID,All day long driving.,BXS
ID,"The country gets wilder as we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us and tower in front.",BXS
ID,We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves.,BXS
ID,Dr. Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass.,BXS
ID,"The houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change.",BXS
ID,"He got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude four-in-hand.",BXS
ID,"The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no trouble.",BXS
ID,"We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can drive.",BXS
ID,We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive before.,BXS
ID,"So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn.",BXS
ID,"Oh, what will to-morrow bring to us?",BXS
ID,We go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much.,BXS
ID,"God grant that we may be guided aright, and that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both, and who are in such deadly peril.",BXS
ID,"As for me, I am not worthy in His sight.",BXS
ID,Alas!,BXS
ID,"I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred His wrath.",BXS
ID,"This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him.",BXS
ID,It may explain.,BXS
ID,"It is morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept alive--Madam Mina aiding me.",BXS
ID,"It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it.",BXS
ID,It seems to have affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself.,BXS
ID,"She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps!",BXS
ID,"She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite.",BXS
ID,"She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause.",BXS
ID,Something whisper to me that all is not well.,BXS
ID,"However, to-night she is more _vif_.",BXS
ID,"Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever.",BXS
ID,"At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas!",BXS
ID,"with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether.",BXS
ID,"Well, God's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!",BXS
ID,"Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go unrecorded.",BXS
ID,We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning.,BXS
ID,When I saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism.,BXS
ID,"We stopped our carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance.",BXS
ID,"I made a couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep.",BXS
ID,"As before, came the answer: ""darkness and the swirling of water"".",BXS
ID,"Then she woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.",BXS
ID,"At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--  ""This is the way"".",BXS
ID,"""How know you it""?",BXS
ID,I ask.,BXS
ID,"""Of course I know it,"" she answer, and with a pause, add: ""Have not my Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel""?",BXS
ID,"At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one such by-road.",BXS
ID,"It is used but little, and very different from the coach road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and more of use.",BXS
ID,"So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow have fallen--the horses know and they only.",BXS
ID,"I give rein to them, and they go on so patient.",BXS
ID,By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him.,BXS
ID,"Then we go on for long, long hours and hours.",BXS
ID,"At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and she succeed.",BXS
ID,"She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her.",BXS
ID,"But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.",BXS
ID,"I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be all-in-all to her.",BXS
ID,"I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever.",BXS
ID,I look down and find Madam Mina still sleep.,BXS
ID,"It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.",BXS
ID,"For we are going up, and up; and all is oh!",BXS
ID,"so wild and rocky, as though it were the end of the world.",BXS
ID,Then I arouse Madam Mina.,BXS
ID,"This time she wake with not much trouble, and then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep.",BXS
ID,"But she sleep not, being as though I were not.",BXS
ID,"Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.",BXS
ID,"Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her.",BXS
ID,"She is now quite awake, and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we first enter the Count's house.",BXS
ID,"I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear.",BXS
ID,"I light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter, to feed.",BXS
ID,Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready.,BXS
ID,"I go to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that she was so hungry that she would not wait.",BXS
ID,"I like it not, and I have grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it.",BXS
ID,"She help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch.",BXS
ID,"But presently I forget all of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes.",BXS
ID,"Once, twice more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning.",BXS
ID,When I wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas!,BXS
ID,"though she shut her eyes obedient, she may not sleep.",BXS
ID,"The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake.",BXS
ID,"I have to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have harnessed the horses and made all ready.",BXS
ID,"Madam still sleep, and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before.",BXS
ID,And I like it not.,BXS
ID,"And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!",BXS
ID,#NAME?,BXS
ID,"The stake we play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.",BXS
ID,"Let me be accurate in everything, for though you and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.",BXS
ID,"All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and moving into a more and more wild and desert land.",BXS
ID,"There are great, frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held sometime her carnival.",BXS
ID,"Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food.",BXS
ID,"I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism.",BXS
ID,"""Well,"" said I to myself, ""if it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night"".",BXS
ID,"As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept.",BXS
ID,"Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down.",BXS
ID,"But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary.",BXS
ID,"At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill, the end was near.",BXS
ID,"I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!",BXS
ID,unavailing till too late.,BXS
ID,"Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could.",BXS
ID,"Then I make a fire; and near it I make Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid her rugs.",BXS
ID,"I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that she had not hunger.",BXS
ID,"I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness.",BXS
ID,"But I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all.",BXS
ID,"Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded.",BXS
ID,She sat still all the time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said.,BXS
ID,"But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel.",BXS
ID,"I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:--  ""Will you not come over to the fire""?",BXS
ID,for I wished to make a test of what she could.,BXS
ID,"She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood as one stricken.",BXS
ID,"""Why not go on""?",BXS
ID,I asked.,BXS
ID,"She shook her head, and, coming back, sat down in her place.",BXS
ID,"Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked from sleep, she said simply:--  ""I cannot""!",BXS
ID,and remained silent.,BXS
ID,"I rejoiced, for I knew that what she could not, none of those that we dreaded could.",BXS
ID,"Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!",BXS
ID,"Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them.",BXS
ID,"When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time.",BXS
ID,"Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was with quiet of them.",BXS
ID,"In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.",BXS
ID,"Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments.",BXS
ID,"All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst.",BXS
ID,I began to fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein I stood.,BXS
ID,"I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety.",BXS
ID,"It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him.",BXS
ID,"And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain.",BXS
ID,"Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away.",BXS
ID,I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round.,BXS
ID,"I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:--  ""No!",BXS
ID,Do not go without.,BXS
ID,"Here you are safe""!",BXS
ID,"I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:--  ""But you?",BXS
ID,"It is for you that I fear""!",BXS
ID,"whereat she laughed--a laugh, low and unreal, and said:--  ""Fear for _me_!",BXS
ID,Why fear for me?,BXS
ID,"None safer in all the world from them than I am,"" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.",BXS
ID,"Then, alas!",BXS
ID,I knew.,BXS
ID,"Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle.",BXS
ID,"Then they began to materialise till--if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat.",BXS
ID,"I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips.",BXS
ID,"They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--  ""Come, sister.",BXS
ID,"In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh!",BXS
ID,"the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope.",BXS
ID,"God be thanked she was not, yet, of them.",BXS
ID,"I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire.",BXS
ID,"They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh.",BXS
ID,"I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections.",BXS
ID,"They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter.",BXS
ID,"The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter.",BXS
ID,I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.,BXS
ID,And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom.,BXS
ID,"I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.",BXS
ID,"At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.",BXS
ID,"Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her.",BXS
ID,"I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made no response, none at all; and the day broke.",BXS
ID,I fear yet to stir.,BXS
ID,"I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead.",BXS
ID,"To-day I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.",BXS
ID,"I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible work.",BXS
ID,"Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked!",BXS
ID,she is calm in her sleep.,BXS
ID,The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us.,BXS
ID,Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago; and by now my dear Mina would have been free.,BXS
ID,"I fear to think of her, off on the wolds near that horrid place.",BXS
ID,"We have got horses, and we follow on the track.",BXS
ID,I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready.,BXS
ID,We have our arms.,BXS
ID,The Szgany must look out if they mean fight.,BXS
ID,"Oh, if only Morris and Seward were with us.",BXS
ID,We must only hope!,BXS
ID,"If I write no more Good-bye, Mina!",BXS
ID,God bless and keep you.,BXS
ID,With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiter-wagon.,BXS
ID,"They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset.",BXS
ID,The snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air.,BXS
ID,"It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange.",BXS
ID,"Far off I hear the howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides.",BXS
ID,"The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off.",BXS
ID,We ride to death of some one.,BXS
ID,"God alone knows who, or where, or what, or when, or how it may be.",BXS
ID,"Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful.",BXS
ID,"When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.",BXS
ID,"The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out.",BXS
ID,Jonathan's bitter experience served me here.,BXS
ID,"By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay.",BXS
ID,"The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy.",BXS
ID,Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.,BXS
ID,"Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.",BXS
ID,The dilemma had me between his horns.,BXS
ID,"Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf!",BXS
ID,"I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were God's will.",BXS
ID,At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond.,BXS
ID,So did I choose for her.,BXS
ID,"Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire!",BXS
ID,So I make my choice to go on with my work.,BXS
ID,"I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them.",BXS
ID,"She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder.",BXS
ID,"Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve.",BXS
ID,"So he delay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over.",BXS
ID,"Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss--and man is weak.",BXS
ID,And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!,BXS
ID,"There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had.",BXS
ID,"Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul.",BXS
ID,"It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me.",BXS
ID,"Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion.",BXS
ID,For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.,BXS
ID,"Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one.",BXS
ID,"I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist.",BXS
ID,"She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion.",BXS
ID,"But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work.",BXS
ID,"By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.",BXS
ID,"There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned.",BXS
ID,On it was but one word.,BXS
ID,"This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due.",BXS
ID,Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.,BXS
ID,"Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.",BXS
ID,"Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.",BXS
ID,"Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative.",BXS
ID,But three!,BXS
ID,"To begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives.",BXS
ID,"Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on.",BXS
ID,"I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand.",BXS
ID,"Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone further with my butchery.",BXS
ID,"I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of writhing form, and lips of bloody foam.",BXS
ID,I should have fled in terror and left my work undone.,BXS
ID,But it is over!,BXS
ID,"And the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading.",BXS
ID,"For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud ""I am here""!",BXS
ID,Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead.,BXS
ID,"When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.",BXS
ID,"she said, ""come away from this awful place!",BXS
ID,"Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards us"".",BXS
ID,She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour.,BXS
ID,"I was glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.",BXS
ID,"And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are coming to meet us.",BXS
ID,It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.,BXS
ID,"We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow.",BXS
ID,"We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation.",BXS
ID,"When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest.",BXS
ID,Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far below it.,BXS
ID,"We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side.",BXS
ID,There was something wild and uncanny about the place.,BXS
ID,We could hear the distant howling of wolves.,BXS
ID,"They were far off, but the sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror.",BXS
ID,"I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack.",BXS
ID,The rough roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.,BXS
ID,"In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him.",BXS
ID,"He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders.",BXS
ID,"He took me by the hand and drew me in: ""See""!",BXS
ID,"he said, ""here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one"".",BXS
ID,"He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and forced them upon me.",BXS
ID,"But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt.",BXS
ID,"He looked very sad, but did not reproach me.",BXS
ID,"Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon.",BXS
ID,I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed.,BXS
ID,"The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow.",BXS
ID,"However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round.",BXS
ID,"From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way.",BXS
ID,"Straight in front of us and not far off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a group of mounted men hurrying along.",BXS
ID,"In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road.",BXS
ID,"Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.",BXS
ID,On the cart was a great square chest.,BXS
ID,"My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming.",BXS
ID,"The evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit.",BXS
ID,"In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation, however, he was not there.",BXS
ID,"An instant later, I saw him below me.",BXS
ID,"Round the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last night.",BXS
ID,"When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--  ""At least you shall be safe here from _him_""!",BXS
ID,"He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.",BXS
ID,"""See,"" he said, ""they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can"".",BXS
ID,"He paused and went on in a hollow voice:--  ""They are racing for the sunset.",BXS
ID,We may be too late.,BXS
ID,"God's will be done""!",BXS
ID,"Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out.",BXS
ID,"It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain.",BXS
ID,"See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south.",BXS
ID,It must be Quincey and John.,BXS
ID,Take the glass.,BXS
ID,"Look before the snow blots it all out""!",BXS
ID,I took it and looked.,BXS
ID,The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.,BXS
ID,I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.,BXS
ID,"At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed.",BXS
ID,"One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming.",BXS
ID,"They, too, were pursuing the party with the cart.",BXS
ID,"When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter.",BXS
ID,"""They are all converging,"" he said.",BXS
ID,"""When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides"".",BXS
ID,"I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer.",BXS
ID,When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.,BXS
ID,"It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops.",BXS
ID,Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.,BXS
ID,Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited.,BXS
ID,"The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies.",BXS
ID,"At times we could not see an arm's length before us; but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off.",BXS
ID,"We had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the sun would set.",BXS
ID,It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us.,BXS
ID,"The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north.",BXS
ID,"It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell.",BXS
ID,"We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers.",BXS
ID,"Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops.",BXS
ID,Closer and closer they drew.,BXS
ID,"The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass.",BXS
ID,One and all were quite unaware of our presence.,BXS
ID,"All at once two voices shouted out to: ""Halt""!",BXS
ID,"One was my Jonathan's, raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute tone of quiet command.",BXS
ID,"The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken.",BXS
ID,"Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other.",BXS
ID,"The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed.",BXS
ID,"They lashed the horses which sprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop.",BXS
ID,At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.,BXS
ID,Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up.,BXS
ID,"The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack.",BXS
ID,Issue was joined in an instant.,BXS
ID,"The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.",BXS
ID,"For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart.",BXS
ID,"I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something.",BXS
ID,"Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.",BXS
ID,"In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set.",BXS
ID,Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them.,BXS
ID,"Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention.",BXS
ID,"Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass.",BXS
ID,"In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground.",BXS
ID,"In the meantime, Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany.",BXS
ID,"All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him.",BXS
ID,"He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers.",BXS
ID,"He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie.",BXS
ID,"Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back.",BXS
ID,"By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance.",BXS
ID,"The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow.",BXS
ID,"I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him.",BXS
ID,"He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.",BXS
ID,"As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.",BXS
ID,"But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.",BXS
ID,I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.,BXS
ID,"It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from our sight.",BXS
ID,"I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.",BXS
ID,"The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun.",BXS
ID,"The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives.",BXS
ID,Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them.,BXS
ID,"The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.",BXS
ID,"Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers.",BXS
ID,"I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors.",BXS
ID,Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder.,BXS
ID,"With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained.",BXS
ID,"He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--  ""I am only too happy to have been of any service!",BXS
ID,"The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.",BXS
ID,"With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest ""Amen"" broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger.",BXS
ID,"The dying man spoke:--  ""Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain!",BXS
ID,the snow is not more stainless than her forehead!,BXS
ID,"The curse has passed away""!",BXS
ID,"And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.",BXS
